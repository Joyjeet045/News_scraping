            "That audiences find her relatable is something Roberts is acutely aware of, for better or worse. “I will say that I think there’s something in me that’s always (let) people feel they’re comfortable, or they see something familiar,” she explained. “If someone sees me in a grocery store and they say, ‘Why did you cut your hair like that?’ it’s not because they’re trying to be rude. It’s because they feel they know me, that I sit behind them in church every Sunday.”\n",
            "\n",
            "“It’s that sense of feeling that you understand someone that you don’t know. I guess looking relatively like myself in most parts takes me out of the character-actor lane. But I never feel like I’m playing myself.”\n",
            "\n",
            "To this point, Roberts reminded Curtis that she had almost turned down the “uncomfortable” part of movie star Anna Scott in “Notting Hill,” calling it “one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do.”\n",
            "\n",
            "“It just seemed so awkward,” she said of the role “I didn’t even know how to play that person.” And in a meta twist, Roberts explained that she hated dressing as a movie star so much that she chose to wear her own clothes in the scene where she delivers the movie’s now-iconic line, “I’m also just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Opting out of the wardrobe provided on-set, Roberts said she sent her driver back to her apartment with instructions to raid her closet. “It was my own flip-flops and my cute little blue velvet skirt and a T-shirt and my cardigan,” she said.\n",

            "About this time last year, Ben Shelton was an up-and-coming tennis player taking his first-ever trip outside the United States.\n",
            "\n",
            "Not long out of college, Shelton was relatively unknown on the circuit having only been pro for the past six months. But armed with a lethal serve and the fearlessness of youth, things were about to change – fast.\n",
            "\n",
            "“I feel like it went from nobody knowing me to a lot of people knowing me kind of overnight,” Shelton tells CNN Sport. “It felt really quick.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Skip ahead 12 months and the 21-year-old American is in Australia preparing to play in his sixth grand slam and second at Melbourne Park.\n",
            "\n",
            "At this point in his young career, Shelton’s results have been excellent: he reached the quarterfinals of last year’s Australian Open and went a step further at the US Open, eventually losing to Novak Djokovic in a fiery semifinal. Several weeks after that, he won his first ATP Tour title in Japan.\n",
            "\n",
            "It figures, then, that Shelton enters his second full season as a professional tennis player with weighty expectations.\n",
            "\n",
            "“He could cut his ranking in half,” tennis coach and broadcaster Brad Gilbert recently told CNN, “and I think he’s going to be the first American [man] potentially to win a slam since Andy Roddick.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Shelton celebrates winning match point against Frances Tiafoe in the 2023 US Open quarterfinals. Geoff Burke/USA TODAY Sports/Reuters\n",
            "\n",
            "It’s now been just over 20 years since Roddick triumphed at the US Open, and Shelton is the latest American looking to end that drought. He is currently 16th in the world rankings and has the company of compatriots Taylor Fritz, Tommy Paul and Frances Tiafoe in the top 20.\n",
            "\n",
            "Shelton, however, is coy about his ambitions for the year ahead.\n",
            "\n",
            "“I feel like no matter what you say in the press, someone’s going say: ‘Oh, you shot too high or you shot too low,’” he says.\n",
            "\n",
            "“So I’m going to keep my result-based goals between me and my team … I don’t have anything in my mind that I’m really setting out for yet. I feel like I don’t want to put a ceiling on myself and what I can achieve. I just want to take things one step at a time and see where I am at the end of this year.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Shelton’s career path to date has been unconventional. Football was his primary passion until the age of 12 or 13, and despite his family pedigree – Shelton’s dad and uncle were professional tennis players, while his mom was an accomplished junior – he was under no pressure to take up the sport himself.\n",
            "\n",
            "It was only after seeing his sister travel to tournaments across the country that Shelton was convinced to take tennis more seriously and begin his rise through the junior ranks.\n",
            "\n",
            "Shelton won his first ATP Tour title at the Japan Open after defeating Aslan Karatsev in the final. Kazuhiro Nogi/AFP/Getty Images\n",
            "\n",
            "But even in a sport that loves to celebrate teenage champions – Carlos Alcaraz, Coco Gauff and Emma Raducanu, for example – Shelton decided to spend his formative years closer to home. He enrolled at the University of Florida, where his dad was the coach, and went on to win the NCAA singles title in 2022.\n",
            "\n",
            "“There’s not one path for everybody, and I don’t think that my path is perfect, but it really worked for me,” says Shelton. “At this point, at 21 years old, I feel fairly fresh. I haven’t been out here that long. I don’t feel burned out at all.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Tennis can be a grueling sport with the schedule and amount of travel, so I’m glad that I got a little bit of a later start. I don’t feel like I have too many miles on my body yet.”\n",
            "\n",
            "On the court, Shelton is physical and powerful. A six-foot-four left-hander, his serve is his most dangerous weapon – “a rocket shooting up off the ground,” according to Scott Perelman, a coach at the University of Florida.\n",
            "\n",
            "At last year’s US Open, Shelton hit two serves at 149 miles per hour in his fourth-round match – just three miles per hour short of the tournament record, which is owned by Roddick.\n",
            "\n",
            "But the Georgia native doesn’t want to be seen as a one-dimensional, serve-smashing automaton, and he believes that he arrives at the Australian Open as a far more accomplished player compared to last season.\n",
            "\n",
            "Shelton prepares to hit a serve at last year's US Open. On\n",
            "\n",
            "“I feel like I’m worlds ahead of where I was a year ago,” he says. “I’m much more solid from the baseline. I think I’m also more comfortable taking away time and coming forward to the net.\n",
            "\n",
            "“But I’d say the biggest factor is probably my movement. I think I’m a much better mover and player out of the corners, and when moving hard side to side and forward and backwards.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Shelton has been coached by his father, Bryan, since June last year. Even at the age of 19, the former Georgia Tech and Florida coach said that he could see how his son was “a different animal” than he was during his playing days, and the younger Shelton has so far been enjoying their player-coach relationship.\n",
            "\n",
            "“There’s no other person in the world who knows me better, what makes me tick, the things that I’m good at, the things I need to improve on,” he says.\n",

Ahead of its 34th edition, in Ivory Coast, look through the gallery to see photos of some of the competition's most memorable moments. Pictured, Cameroon players celebrate their triumph in 2017. Gabriel Bouys/AFP/Getty Images Though the inaugural tournament in 1957 featured just three teams (Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan), eight sides made up the competition by the 12th edition in Nigeria, 1980. Led by captain Christian Chukwu, pictured with the trophy in hand, the hosts beat Algeria 3-0 to clinch their first AFCON title in style. Peter Robinson/EMPICS/Getty Images Libya's dream of hosting the tournament for the first in its history ended in heartbreak in 1982. Having reached the final in Tripoli, the Mediterranean Knights suffered a 7-6 loss on penalties after a 1-1 draw with Ghana. They have not reached the tournament's final four since. Peter Robinson/PA Images/Getty Images Cameroon's Francois N'doumbe hurdles a robust challenge from Pascal Miezen, midfielder for competition hosts Ivory Coast in 1984. N'doumbe and the Indomitable Lions lived up to their nickname at the tournament, condemning the hosts to a group stage exit before going on to beat Nigeria 3-1 in the final to claim the first of their five AFCON crowns. David Cannon/Allsport/Getty Image South Africa was never expected to stage AFCON 1996, let alone win it. Assigned hosting duties after original organizers Kenya were stripped of the role due to inadequate preparations, a fairytale run saw \"Bafana Bafana,\" as the national team is known, walk out in front of 80,000 spectators at Soccer City, Johannesburg, for the final against Tunisia. Per-Anders Pettersson/Getty Images A second-half brace from Mark Williams fired South Africa to a famous 2-0 victory in the 1996 final, allowing captain Neil Hovey -- pictured here along with dignitaries including President Nelson Mandela -- to hoist aloft the country's sole AFCON trophy to date. Arriving just eight months on from the country's legendary Rugby World Cup win on home soil, it sealed another famous sporting achievement for post-apartheid South Africa. Mark Thompson/Getty Images South Africa came within 90 minutes of defending its title in Burkina Faso two years later, but fell 2-0 in the final to Egypt, which claimed its fourth AFCON title. José Nicolas/Corbis/Getty Images 2000 marked the first time AFCON was hosted by two countries -- Nigeria and Ghana. Ghana, shown warming up before a group match against Togo, were knocked out in the quarter finals by South Africa, who were in turn beaten by Nigeria in the semi-finals. John Sibley/Action Images/Reuters Samuel Eto'o may well be heralded as Cameroon's -- and possibly even Africa's -- greatest ever player, but strike partner Patrick M'Boma, pictured, played an even more pivotal role in the country's dramatic final triumph over Nigeria in 2000. Both scored in the 2-2 draw, but with Eto'o substituted off during regular time, M'Boma stayed on to convert the first penalty of a 4-3 shootout win, and was subsequently awarded African Footballer of the Year. Eric Renard/Icon Sport/Getty Images After triumphing in one of the competition's all-time great penalty shootouts at the 2006 AFCON quarter-final stage -- beating Cameroon in a 12-11 epic -- Ivory Coast incurred the wrath of the spot kick gods in the final. The Elephants lost 4-2 on penalties to Egypt following a goalless draw as the hosts claimed their fifth AFCON win. Christian Liewig/Corbis/Getty Images Chelsea legend Didier Drogba was center-stage again for entirely different reasons during the AFCON qualifying stages in 2007. Credited with playing a role in helping to end Ivory Coast's bloody civil war , pictures of the striker being escorted off the pitch by Ivorian rebel soldiers moments after scoring the final goal in a 5-0 win over Madagascar in Bouake -- the base of the rebellion -- symbolized his unifying impact. Issouf Sanogo/AFP/Getty Images Ghana buzzed with excitement after a late goal from striker Manuel Agogo sent the hosts into the semi-final in 2008, yet a subsequent 1-0 defeat to Cameroon would deny the Black Stars their dreams of a third AFCON win on home ground. Gianluigi Guercia/AFP/Getty Images The lead up to AFCON 2010 in Angola was marked by tragedy when a bus transporting the Togo team was fired on with machine guns in a terrorist attack , killing three and leaving at least seven others wounded. Despite the players' wishes, the Togolese government ordered the team to withdraw, leading to a two-tournament suspension from The Confederation of African Football (CAF). The ban was lifted a few months later following an appeal from Togo to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Emile Kouton/AFP/Getty Images After two previous final defeats, Zambia finally clinched their first AFCON title in fairytale fashion at the 2012 tournament in Gabon, defeating Ivory Coast in a nail-biting penalty shoot-out in Libreville. Head coach Herve Renard dedicated the win to the victims of the plane crash that killed the team's coach and 18 squad members shortly after taking off from Libreville in 1993. Rebecca Blackwell/AP Cameroonian players warm up ahead of their 2017 final against Egypt in Libreville. Despite eight of their star players refusing Belgian coach Hugo Broos' call up to the squad for the tournament, the Indomitable Lions defied the odds , as Vincent Aboubakar's late winner completed a 2-1 comeback and clinched a fifth AFCON title. Gabriel Bouys/AFP/Getty Images Yacine Brahimi and his teammates celebrated Algeria's second-ever AFCON win in 2019, as Baghdad Bounedjah's early deflected goal - Algeria's only shot of the game - was enough to secure a 1-0 victory over Senegal in Cairo, Egypt. Suhaib Salem/Reuters Yet Senegal exorcised the demons of that painful loss on the first attempt at the pandemic-delayed 2022 tournament in Cameroon, defeating Egypt on penalties following a goalless draw -- and subsequently parading the country's first ever AFCON trophy through the streets of Dakar.

            "Tom and Aileen White purchased a home in the Italian village of Exilles back in 2017. Tom Winter\n",
            "\n",
            "As no address was given, he decided to head to Exilles, situated about an or so from from Turin by car, to try to locate it himself.\n",
            "\n",
            "On arriving, Tom was immediately impressed by the village, which has a population of around 250, and quickly tracked down the unusual home.\n",
            "\n",
            "After speaking to some locals, he was able to find the owners and set about convincing them to sell him the property.\n",
            "\n",
            "“They met us the next day and we bought the house on a handshake,” explains Aileen, who runs a real estate consultancy.\n",
            "\n",
            "They purchased the tower for 19,000 euros (around $21,000) in October 2017.\n",
            "\n",
            "The couple say they faced some minor issues during the sale process, particularly with regards to opening an Italian bank account, but were able to overcome this hurdle with the help of an Italy-based attorney.\n",
            "\n",
            "Once the sale was finalized in early 2018, Tom flew into Italy from the US, “picked up the keys over pizza in Turin” and set about beginning the process of transforming the four-story home into a suitable vacation house for he and Aileen.\n",
            "\n",
            "“I arrived in a snowstorm and everything was gray and dark,” he says. “The village is quite lively in the summer, but it’s very quiet in winter.\n",
            "\n",
            "“I fell into a weird kind of despair, where [I was thinking], ‘Oh my god, what have I done?’”\n",
            "\n",
            "Fortunately a visit from a friend raised his spirits, and he focused his energies on ripping out the old carpet and linoleum and cleaning out the home in order to prepare it for the renovation.\n",
            "\n",
            "“The old kerosene stove worked for approximately five minutes,” he recalls.\n",
            "\n",
            "‘Magical place’\n",
            "\n",
            "The couple say that they've been embraced \"like family\" by the local community in Exilles. Tom Winter\n",
            "\n",
            "Once Aileen had arrived, and the couple found an architect for the project, they quickly got to know the locals, who were surprised that they’d chosen to buy a home in Exilles, which is close to Gran Bosco national park.\n",
            "\n",
            "“The big question was, ‘Why are you here?’” explains Aileen. “This is a real working village where people live off the land and there’s a lot of trading of vegetables, fruits and potatoes.\n",
            "\n",
            "“So they would ask, “Why here?’ And we just kept saying, ‘Because it’s a magical place.’”\n",
            "\n",
            "According to the Winters, the renovation process took around six months, with the total cost amounting to around $94,000.\n",
            "\n",
            "“It was kind of habitable to start,” explains Tom. “But we’ve modernized it and made it quite nice.”\n",
            "\n",
            "They transformed the ground level of the home, which previously featured a small bathroom with just a sink and a toilet, to a large bathroom with a shower and laundry facilities.\n",
            "\n",
            "They also replaced the staircase with an open stairway in order to bring more light into the property, and added a new hot water system fueled by a pellet stove.\n",
            "\n",
            "In addition, the Winters have built a new kitchen on the second level of the house, which has a balcony, while the old kitchen has been converted into a living area.\n",
            "\n",
            "“It’s a very small place,” adds Tom. “There’s only so much you can do. So it’s quite an easy process compared to some of the projects that people get involved in.”\n",
            "\n",
            "In the years since they purchased the property, which they’ve named Torre Piccolo, the couple, who visit Piedmont four or five times a year, have formed strong friendships within the village and say they’ve been welcomed generously.\n",
            "\n",
            "“The people in the village have embraced us like family,” says Aileen, recalling how they were initially known as “Li Americani.”\n",
            "\n",
            "They’ve since bought a second property in Exilles, and say that the strength of the community has been a huge part of the village’s appeal.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Everyone’s been incredibly kind and patient with us,” says Tom. “They appreciate that we love Exilles. They’re quite proud of their little village and rightfully so.\n",
            "\n",
            "“It’s an interesting place surrounded by beautiful balance in nature, and it’s been really well preserved. So they should be proud.”\n",
            "\n",
            "The couple have developed a close friendship with the previous owner of the home, who Aileen describes as one of her “dearest friends in Italy.”\n",
            "\n",
            "“Her son just had a baby and we went to visit,” she adds. “So a beautiful friendship came from this purchase.”\n",
            "\n",
            "As few people in Exilles speak English, Aileen and Tom have both made a huge effort to learn the language, enrolling in immersive language courses at language schools.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, the Winters concede that Aileen has picked the language up more easily over time, which is something that hasn’t gone unnoticed among the locals.\n",
            "\n",
            "“I was telling them that I was going to language school for a few weeks,” Aileen says of a recent conversation with some of their neighbors.\n",
            "\n",
            "Slower pace\n",
            "\n",
            "The Winters spent around $94,000 renovating Torre Piccolo, which has five rooms. Tom Winter\n",
            "\n",
            "“And the first question was, ‘Why isn’t Tom going? He needs it more than you do.’”\n",
            "\n",
            "While they’re very much enamored with Exilles, the pair admit that there are some aspects of life in a small Italian village that they’ve had to adjust to.\n",
            "\n",
            "“We’ve learned to understand that if you show up at the grocery store on a Tuesday at 10 a.m, it might be closed because that particular store has their own hours,” says Aileen.\n",
            "\n",
            "“And sometimes you’ll go to a restaurant at eight o’clock at night and it’s closed, because there’s a family birthday party. So you just have to understand and be adaptable.”\n",
            "\n",
            "According to the Winters, the slower pace of life has helped them to become less “uptight” about things.\n",
            "\n",
            "“It’s a good adjustment. You learn to slow down and become a little more relaxed about the processes,” says Tom. “And that’s been beautiful. We really do disconnect when we go there.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Although the Winters say they’d love to eventually be able to spend half of the year in Piedmont, they don’t have long stay visas, and tourist visas only permit them to stay for 90 days at a time.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, Tom believes it will be a long while before they’re ready to think about settling in Italy for good, noting that they’re keen to hold on to their properties in the US.\n",
            "\n",
            "“I don’t think we’re quite there yet,” he says, adding that there are some things about life in Italy that they’d find “challenging” to deal with permanently.\n",
            "\n",
            "“It would be hard for me to be subjected to the notorious Italian bureaucracy full time and the tax ramifications for us. So the ongoing conversation that we’re having is [about] how that would work.”\n",
            "\n",
            "For the time being, the Winters are working towards being able to spend four or five months of the year in Italy, and say that they’d love to bring their cat over and spend more time in their garden planting.\n",
            "\n",
            "The couple are sometimes asked for advice by other US families hoping to move to Italy, and say that they always advise them to spend time finding the destination that suits them best, pointing out that while Exilles has been ideal for them, “it isn’t right for everyone.”\n",
            "\n",
            "“That ‘Under the Tuscan Sun’ dream that people find is really, really cool,” says Aileen.\n",
            "\n",
            "“So if you have a dream to go live in Provence. Or if you want to be in Tuscany, or in Spain somewhere, then do it.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Don’t just talk about it. Go make it happen. But I encourage people to seriously find their space.”\n",
            "\n",
            "This sentiment is echoed by Tom, who stresses that while he wouldn’t advise anyone to buy a house on a handshake, he’s thrilled with the way things have turned out.\n",
            "\n",
            "“This started an idea [that we thought] could be something fun to do,” he says. “But the thing that’s really blown us away, is how it’s been an investment in our soul. And how kind the people are.\n",
            "\n",
            "“The ROI is really that human experience. That’s exceeded every expectation we ever could have had.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the couple’s family name in the first paragraph.\n",

Instead, birds, dogs and horses pose and frolic with the women in her paintings, with her sitters including the fashion designer Coco Chanel and the socialite Maud “Emerald” Cunard.\n",

            "Laurencin was a complicated figure by today’s standards, and parts of her life are still not entirely understood, according to the exhibition’s curators. She felt a sense of otherness on account of her working class background and, possibly, her ethnicity — Laurencin believed herself to have Creole heritage, and reflected this in self-portraits (though genealogical evidence remains unconfirmed, according to the catalog). She also remained in Paris during World War II while many other artists fled, and some of her private writings from the time expressed support for Marshal Philippe Pétain, who helmed the collaborationist Vichy France regime during Nazi occupation.\n",

Moreau, her partner, kept much of her work until the end of her life, meaning few paintings were accessible to the public. In the 1970s, as pieces came to auction, the Japanese collector Masahiro Takano became her most ardent buyer, amassing hundreds of paintings and drawings. (Barnes’ founder Albert C. Barnes was also a collector of her work.) Takano’s collection served as the basis for the Marie Laurencin Museum, which first opened in Tateshina, a town in Japan’s Nagano prefecture, but relocated to Tokyo in 2017.\n",

After the arrival of European colonizers in the 1800s, the process was industrialized, starting with a number of small-scale operations and then giants such as Cargill taking over. At its peak, salt ponds covered around 36,000 acres throughout the Bay. Today, Cargill still operates 12,000 acres of salt ponds, capable of crystallizing half a million tons of sea salt each year.\n",

She is the subject of the Lifetime docuseries “The Prison Confessions of Gypsy Rose Blanchard” and recently told CNN in an interview: “For me, getting to prison was a chance to start life for myself in terms of gaining independence from everyone.”\n",
            "\n",
            "The idea of prison as a place to find oneself for the first time may seem shocking for most of us, but less so for Blanchard, who was for years paraded before reporters and the public as a sickly cancer patient, before it was revealed that her own mother, Claudine “Dee Dee” Blanchard, had been slowly poisoning her. The revelation drove Gypsy Rose to seek revenge by convincing her boyfriend to murder her mother.\n",
            "\n",
            "Later, it was revealed that Dee Dee had “factitious disorder imposed on another,” formerly yet more commonly known as Munchausen-by-proxy, a rare syndrome in which the caretaker of a child, most often a mother, either makes up fake symptoms or causes real symptoms to make it look like the child is sick.\n",
            "\n",
            "Blanchard’s case, and the obsessive following of its every detail, brings to mind the story of former child actress and Nickelodeon star Jennette McCurdy, another daughter whose toxic relationship with her mother became the subject of media scrutiny and prurient interest. McCurdy spoke out purposefully about her experiences in her bestselling 2022 book, “I’m Glad My Mother Died,” which describes how her narcissist mother Debra pushed her into an acting career as a child, and then so hounded her about her caloric intake that she became malnourished and developed severe eating disorders, as well as alcoholism.\n",

            "Of course, the behavior of Dee Dee Blanchard and Debra McCurdy was beyond the pale, rising to the level of evil. But as a psychologist, I often wonder if the so-called “wicked mother paradigm,” like so many forms of othering, may be hiding more about us than it reveals about them. What if instead of asking questions about these evil mothers or avidly attending to the details of their children’s lives, we viewed stories like these as an opportunity to ask difficult questions of ourselves and our own relationships?\n",
            "\n",
            "While we are following these stories so breathlessly, I believe we owe it to ourselves to ask about the similarities we share with Blanchard and McCurdy, even those we might not want to admit to. The fact that those of us who are mothers would never behave like Blanchard or McCurdy risks becoming a way of avoiding the small ways that these stories mirror our own — not because we act like them, but because, like them, many mothers are often suffering in silence, unable or unwilling to get help or talk about it.\n",
            "\n",
            "In telling the stories of Blanchard and McCurdy, the media makes scant mention of the fact that both were clearly suffering from their own forms of mental illness, yet neither woman was treated. Jennette McCurdy said about her mother: “Any time that my grandfather or my father tried to encourage her to get help, pleaded with her to get help…she just refused to do it. She refused to acknowledge that she had any issues.” And Gypsy recently said in an interview of her mom: “Maybe it was like an addict with an impulse, and that it was not consciously malicious.”\n",
            "\n",
            "In my practice, I see many mothers suffering with their own forms of anxiety and fear of failure, and for the most part these are not discussed either. “I know better than to tell anyone else this,” mothers in my practice report on a regular basis. Then they go on to admit that they yearn for a day off from parenting, that they were relieved to go back to work after maternity leave or that they have to lock themselves in the bathroom sometimes to avoid yelling at their kids. Often, they can’t make eye contact while admitting these things. “I know that makes me a terrible mom,” they say.\n",

            "According to the images we get on a loop in advertising and the media, parenthood — especially motherhood — is supposed to be blissful, a non-stop endorphin rush of unconditional love and joy. When I suffered my own bout of postpartum depression, I was so conditioned by this paradigm that even with all my training, it took me months to put a name to what I was feeling, and to overcome the shame and guilt that ensued.\n",
            "\n",
            "I’m not surprised anymore when I hear how parents feel that they can’t talk about their fears of maternal failure or doubt outside of therapy. I try to normalize these feelings. In “Far From the Tree,” Andrew Solomon writes, referencing the British psychoanalyst Rozsika Parker, that “in our open, modern society, the extent of maternal ambivalence is a dark secret. Most mothers treat their occasional wish to be rid of their children as if it were the equivalent of murder itself.” But disclosing and discussing our maternal ambivalence make for better parents, not worse ones.\n",

            "“We’re not supposed to put anything else before our children’s needs, right?” I’m often asked. There are very few questions that patients put to me that I answer definitively. This is one of them. “No, that’s not right,” I reply.\n",
            "\n",
            "When someone asks me if I love being a mother, the answer is a definitive yes. Yet I know how much the joy is often shadowed by grief and shame. It took me a very long time to be open and factual not only about my postpartum depression, but also about the five miscarriages that preceded it. How would my experience of motherhood have been different if I didn’t have a good therapist, supportive friends who I trust enough to be vulnerable with, and a partner who would never judge me for my complicated feelings of motherhood and the losses it has entailed?\n",

            "What is it that most people deny and repress? Things that are deemed bad or immoral by society or frowned upon by our family or peers.

Most of us are just trying to do our best at a very hard job, often with scarce resources.\n",

            "As easy as it might be to think of the Dee Dee Blanchards and Debra McCurdys of the world as alien from us, their lives and actions totally unknowable to those of us on the other side of the darkness, it may be more useful to try to understand them. We would like to believe that we aren’t anything like them because we don’t like the lines to be blurry between the monsters of the world and us. But that misses a valuable opportunity.\n",

            "\n",
            "By no means do these societal failures let either of these moms off the hook. What their daughters experienced at their hands was horrific and inexcusable. But their stories should prompt us to ask ourselves if our own journeys in parenthood are not themselves burdened by what we won’t admit to ourselves or to those who might help us. And how, not if, each of us transfers our own internalized shame to our children.\n",

            "The Pope’s statements on surrogacy are an extension of the church’s broader teachings on gender and human life, which essentially amount to this: Make as many babies as possible but also leave it in God’s hands; don’t interrupt the process with contraception or abortion and don’t try to grease the wheels with IVF or surrogacy. It’s a too-simplistic recipe for a complex human desire, vested in our notoriously imperfect and complicated human bodies.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Pope isn’t alone in condemning surrogacy. Paid surrogacy is banned or restricted in large parts of Europe, and surrogacy is illegal in Italy. A few US states have also outlawed it. And yet his choice of words, in their attempt to render as a black-and-white issue something so shot through with nuance and difficulty, reflects how spiritually and ideologically threadbare knee-jerk dogmatism really is when it comes to surrogacy.\n",
            "\n",
            "Surrogacy is among the most ethically thorny reproductive questions. It creates many opportunities for exploitation, with wealthy people who want children willing to pay poorer women to carry and birth them. Feminists often rely on the concept of “choice” when discussing reproduction, and choice is key, but it isn’t the only concern. No choice, after all, is made in a vacuum. And with surrogacy arrangements often involving poor women in developing countries who carry babies for far wealthier people in rich and developed ones, the potential for abuse is high and the negotiating table perilously uneven.\n",
            "\n",
            "How might circumstances shape a woman’s “choice” to be a surrogate if she is desperately poor but can make a decade’s salary by having a baby for a wealthier family, even if doing so sounds tremendously unpleasant? How might it shape her choice if the payment is significantly lower, but she has debts to pay and being a surrogate will bring in much more money than she can make otherwise — even though she’s risking her life, may be warehoused in a hyper-surveilled and hypercontrolled surrogate dormitory, and is potentially being subjected to dangerous pregnancy-maximizing, multiple embryo implantations or unnecessary cesarean sections?\n",

How much choice do surrogate mothers have if, at the end of gestating and birthing a baby, they have no legal right to change their minds, repay the money and keep the child? Many of these circumstances have been realities for women in the developing nations that became global surrogacy capitals. Even in the United States, where surrogacy laws vary by state, surrogate mothers have complained of shocking maltreatment.\n",

            "\n",
            "On the other hand: Who is anyone else to tell a woman what she can and cannot do with her own body? Doesn’t she know, better than any church leader or government official or concerned nongovernmental organization worker, what’s in her best interests? We use our bodies to perform all sorts of labor for others, including, sometimes, labor that mimics our most intimate relationships: Nannies offer not just child care but love for someone else’s children; fertility specialists offer not just health care but the hope and often outcome of a pregnancy.\n",
            "\n",
            "The line between agency and exploitation is not always clear. What is clear is that surrogacy, like international adoption, has too often been a one-way flow of children from poorer countries to richer ones, has attracted all kinds of unscrupulous and abusive actors, and has, as a result, seen crackdowns and limitations come shortly on the heels of broad expansion.\n",
            "\n",
            "The problem, then, isn’t skepticism of surrogacy. It’s the Catholic Church’s overly broad, dogmatic and extreme response to surrogacy.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Pope seems to have given little consideration to the human beings on both ends of a surrogacy arrangement. He has approached a complex issue with obstinacy and insult instead of the nuance and concern it deserves. This is unfortunately typical of the church’s approach to many questions involving sex, gender and reproduction: Simplistic rules made by men with no actual experience or skin in the game, which largely regulate women’s behavior, see our bodies as dangers to be managed and serve to keep us smaller.\n",
            "\n",
            "Frankly, we’d all be a lot better off if religious institutions stayed out of laws governing medical procedures and access, especially when it comes to reproductive rights and women’s lives more broadly. Surrogacy laws remain deeply divisive and hotly debated, not just in religious circles but in feminist ones, too. And I don’t know what a perfect set of laws would look like to maximize women’s agency while fully protecting the vulnerable from exploitation and avoiding a scenario in which surrogates are treated as little more than faraway incubators. In penning these laws, ethics and morality should of course be top considerations. But a moral code developed by a profoundly misogynist male-run institution, formed in part to keep women in their roles as subservient wives and mothers, should have no place in regulating women’s rights and health.\n",

Her performance Thursday night — offering fairly traditional GOP orthodoxy with a blend of compelling personal narrative and present-yet-understated identity politics — may offer GOP voters who are seeking an alternative to Trump their most likely vehicle. The key question, one that Iowa will shed some light on come January 15, is how many of those voters actually exist.”\n",

Because of that, victims of assault — mostly women — blame themselves and are blamed by society. They don’t know what happened to them, but they know that they didn’t scream or say “help,” or they didn’t punch him or whatever. Does that mean that in any way they allowed this to happen? No.\n",

            "In the past, someone would come forward to try to prosecute and the defense would say they didn’t scream or do something, so they must have wanted it or been OK with it — this implication that freezing has anything to do with consent is incorrect. While more people now understand this is not correct, many people still do not understand or want to even accept it as a possibility.

She points out that it would be helpful for her if the perpetrator would say, “I did this. I’m sorry.” Obviously, most perpetrators would never say this. But to some degree, that’s what the legal system is about — it is about a woman saying, “You did this, and this will be the acknowledgement that you did this to me.” Often this goes very badly, or women never bring it to prosecution because of freezing because they know they’ll be blamed in a courtroom.\n",

Look for an expert with credentials that indicate they’re a formal psychologist or psychiatrist, or even a masters of social work. Usually people in practice will have bios about specialty areas they have further training in, such as working with survivors of domestic violence or sexual assault. Professional organizations such as the American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association and the American Psychoanalytic Association have members lists where you can pull up a list of who’s in your area.\n",

            "If you can, speak with trusted people around you who can be supportive and affirm your experience. This is about giving yourself the grace to understand that you have entirely been a victim. Processing doesn’t mean you will forget what happened or that it won’t impact you at all, but ultimately the goal is to build resilience — the idea that one can manage trauma, survive trauma and get back to the person you were prior to the trauma because you’ve built coping skills.\n",

Source: Rakesh How a large scam compound emerged from nothing in rural Myawaddy, Myanmar Satellite images from Maxar and Planet Images obtained by CNN show frenetic construction all across Myawaddy between 2020 and 2023, with new compounds emerging every year and existing ones expanding. Judah Tana, director of the NGO Global Advance Projects, said it wasn't immediately obvious the buildings housed trafficked workers. \"No one knew that hundreds of thousands of people were being brought in and trafficked and trapped inside these compounds,” he said. “This is modern slavery. And it's right under everybody’s nose.” -- Mechelle Moore, November 17, 2023. The compounds function much like small cities with restaurants, grocery stores and even daycare centers. Chinese managers drive around in jeeps and those who stay inside the compound live in townhouses that appear out of place in rural Myanmar. Besides the scam operations, the compounds provide real estate and cover for other crimes, Rakesh says. “Everything is there. Prostitution, drugs, everything is there,” he says. Videos obtained by CNN and filmed by former scammers show office spaces inside the compounds where the scam companies operate from. Dozens of people can be seen working with multiple messaging apps open on their computer screens. Decorating the walls are motivational slogans like “One team, one dream” and “Let your efforts [be] worthy of your ambition” in English and Chinese, according to the videos. Top performing employees are celebrated and rewarded each month, said scammers and NGOs who work with trafficking victims. But this is no ordinary workplace. Scammers who don’t bring in enough victims are punished with hundreds of squats and pushups, beatings with electrical sticks and other punishments that Rakesh says amounted to torture. In some cases, people are sold to other compounds, traded like pawns among the syndicates, Rakesh says. “We are slaves,” Rakesh says. “There is nothing for us to do to help ourselves.

            "وأضاف: \"الفريق ليس في وضع جيد، المنافسون يمتلكون لاعبين بجاهزية عالية واستمرارية في اللعب، لكن لاعبينا منهم من يجلس على دكة البلاء مع أنديتهم، ومنهم من يعاني من تراجع المستوى\".\n",
            "\n",
            "وحول استبعاد اللاعب سلطان الغنام من قائمة الفريق، قال: \"خسر الفريق والمتابعون لاعبا جيدا مثل الغنام، هو متألق في الآونة الأخيرة وفي مختلف البطولات، وارتكب المدرب روبرتو مانشيني خطأً كبيراً باستبعاده\".\n",
            "\n",
            "وأوضح أن \"الحظوظ صعبة، لكن لو لعب اللاعبون بأفضل إمكانياتهم وكمنظومة واحدة سيختلف الأمر كثيراً، وهم يفتقدون للإنجازات باستثناء التأهل للمونديال، لذا عليهم القتال من أجل تحقيق اللقب القاري\".\n",

            "فيما قال فؤاد أنور، لاعب المنتخب السعودي السابق: \"منتخبنا له تاريخ كبير في هذه البطولة، طموح الجماهير تحقيق اللقب بعد غياب لسنوات طوال، أعتقد أنه ستكون لنا كلمة كبيرة في البطولة\".\n",

            "وعن حظوظ الفريق، قال: \"في البداية يجب أن يتأهل الفريق من خلال حجز المركز الأول في مجموعته، ثمّ التفكير في الأدوار الإقصائية\"، موضًحاً: \"المنافسون في البطولة أقوياء للغاية، وتحديداً المنتخب الياباني الّذي تصدر المشهد مؤخراً، وأيضاً المنتخب الأسترالي والمنتخب الكوري الجنوبي، وصاحب الأرض والضيافة، المنتخب القطري\".\n",

Esta Cláusula de Arbitraje debe ser interpretada en sentido amplio. La cláusula incluye, pero no se limita a:\n",
            "\n",
            "reclamos que surjan de o se relacionen con cualquier aspecto de la relación entre nosotros, ya sea que se basen en disposiciones contractuales, actos ilícitos civiles, fraude, tergiversación o cualquier otra figura legal estatutaria o de derecho consuetudinario;\n",

Discovery, Inc. y sus afiliadas); esas entidades y nuestros respectivos agentes, empleados, licenciatarios, licenciantes y proveedores de contenido en el momento en que surja su reclamo o el nuestro; y todos los usuarios o beneficiarios autorizados o no autorizados de Servicios en virtud de este o anteriores Acuerdos entre nosotros. Sin perjuicio de lo anterior, cualquiera de las partes puede optar por que los reclamos se resuelvan en una corte de reclamos menores solicitando solo una reparación individual, siempre que la acción no sea trasladada o apelada a una corte de jurisdicción general. Esta Cláusula de Arbitraje no le impide a usted presentar cuestiones a las agencias federales, estatales o locales. Usted acepta que, al celebrar el presente Acuerdo, tanto usted como nosotros renunciamos al derecho a participar en una demanda colectiva y a un juicio por jurado en la máxima medida permitida por la ley aplicable. Este Acuerdo evidencia una transacción en el comercio interestatal y, por lo tanto, la Ley Federal de Arbitraje (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) rige la interpretación y el cumplimiento de esta cláusula de arbitraje. Esta Cláusula de Arbitraje sobrevivirá la rescisión de este Acuerdo.\n",
            "\n",
            "(2) Notificación Obligatoria Previa al Arbitraje y Procedimientos Informales de Resolución de Disputas: Usted y nosotros acordamos que los esfuerzos informales y de buena fe para resolver disputas a menudo pueden resultar en un resultado rápido, económico y mutuamente beneficioso. Por lo tanto, la parte que tenga la intención de iniciar un arbitraje o presentar un reclamo en una corte de reclamos menores primero debe enviar por escrito a la otra parte una Notificación de Disputa (\"Notificación\"). Una Notificación de usted a CNN debe ser enviada por correo electrónico a notice@wbd.com (“Dirección de Notificación”). Cualquier Notificación debe incluir (i) el nombre del reclamante, su dirección y dirección de correo electrónico; (ii) una descripción de la naturaleza y los fundamentos del reclamo o disputa; (iii) si usted presenta la Notificación, cualquier hecho relevante con respecto a su uso de los Sitios, incluido si ha creado una cuenta o si recibe boletines asociados con cualquiera de los Sitios; (iv) una descripción de la naturaleza y fundamento de la reparación específica solicitada, incluidos los daños reclamados, si los hubiere, y un cálculo detallado de éstos; y (v) una declaración firmada personalmente por el reclamante (no por su abogado) que verifique la exactitud del contenido de la Notificación. La Notificación debe ser individualizada, lo que significa que solo puede referirse a su disputa y no a la disputa de otra persona.\n",
            "\n",
            "Después de recibir una Notificación completa, las partes deberán realizar un esfuerzo de buena fe para resolver la disputa por un período de 60 días (que puede extenderse por acuerdo). Usted y nosotros acordamos que, después de recibir la Notificación completa, el destinatario puede solicitar una conferencia de conciliación telefónica o por video (que se puede realizar después del período de 60 días) y ambas partes asistirán personalmente (con un abogado, si están representadas). Usted y nosotros acordamos que las partes (y los abogados, si están representadas) deberán trabajar cooperativamente para programar la conferencia lo antes posible en cuanto sea conveniente para ambas partes y tratar de llegar a una resolución. Si usted y nosotros no llegamos a un acuerdo para resolver las cuestiones identificadas en la Notificación dentro de los 60 días posteriores a la recepción de la Notificación completa (o en un plazo mayor si las partes así lo acuerdan), usted o nosotros podremos iniciar un procedimiento de arbitraje o un proceso judicial de reclamos menores (si lo permiten las reglas de la corte de reclamos menores).\n",
            "\n",
            "El cumplimiento de esta sección de Notificación Obligatoria Previa al Arbitraje y Procedimientos Informales de Resolución de Disputas es una condición previa para iniciar el arbitraje. Cualquier período de prescripción aplicable (incluidos los periodos de prescripción conforme a la ley) y los plazos para pagar las tarifas de presentación se interrumpirán mientras las partes participan en los procedimientos informales de resolución de disputas establecidos en la Subsección 12.2. Tanto la Notificación Obligatoria Previa al Arbitraje como los Procedimientos Informales de Resolución de Disputas son esenciales para que usted y CNN tengan una oportunidad significativa de resolver disputas de manera informal. Si algún aspecto de estos requisitos no se ha cumplido, una corte competente puede prohibir la presentación o continuación de un arbitraje. Asimismo, a menos que lo prohíba la ley, el administrador del arbitraje no puede aceptar, administrar, evaluar o exigir tarifas en relación con un arbitraje que fue iniciado sin haber completado la Notificación y los Procedimientos Informales de Resolución de Disputas. Si el arbitraje ya se encuentra pendiente, se procederá a su cierre administrativo. Nada en este párrafo limita el derecho de una parte a reclamar en el arbitraje daños y perjuicios por incumplimiento de estos Procedimientos.\n",
            "\n",
            "(3) Procedimiento de Arbitraje: El arbitraje se regirá por las reglas aplicables de Arbitraje y Mediación Nacional (“NAM”) (incluidas las Reglas y Procedimientos Integrales de Resolución de Disputas y/o las Reglas Complementarias para Presentaciones de Arbitraje Masivo , según corresponda) (\"Reglas NAM\"), modificadas por esta Cláusula de Arbitraje, y será administrado por NAM. (Si NAM no está disponible o no está dispuesto a hacerlo, otro proveedor de arbitrajes será seleccionado por las partes, o si las partes no pueden ponerse de acuerdo sobre un administrador alternativo, por la corte de conformidad con 9 U.S.C. § 5). Las Reglas NAM están disponibles en línea en http://www.NAMADR.org, llamando a NAM al 1-800-358-2550, o solicitándolas por escrito a la Dirección de Notificación (disponibles en inglés únicamente). Puede obtener un formulario para iniciar el arbitraje en: https://www.namadr.com/content/uploads/2020/09/Comprehensive-Demand-for-Arb-revised-9.18.19.pdf (disponibles en inglés únicamente) o comunicándose con NAM.\n",
            "\n",
            "Usted y nosotros acordamos que la parte que inicia el arbitraje debe presentar una certificación de que ha cumplido y completado los requisitos de Notificación y Resolución Informal de Disputas a los que se hace referencia en la sección 12.2 y que son parte de la Cláusula de Arbitraje incluida o adjunta a la solicitud de arbitraje. La solicitud de arbitraje y certificación debe estar firmada personalmente por la parte que inicia el arbitraje (y su abogado, si está representada).\n",
            "\n",
            "Todas las cuestiones serán decididas por el árbitro, excepto que se indique expresamente lo contrario aquí y exceptuando las cuestiones relacionadas con el alcance y la exigibilidad de la Cláusula de Arbitraje o si una disputa puede o debe someterse a arbitraje (incluyendo si una disputa está sujeta a esta Cláusula de Arbitraje o a una cláusula de arbitraje previa entre usted y CNN), las cuales serán decididas por una corte competente. El árbitro puede considerar, pero no estará obligado por las decisiones de otros arbitrajes que involucren a diferentes clientes.\n",
            "\n",
            "A menos que usted y nosotros acordemos lo contrario, o las Reglas NAM aplicables expresen lo contrario, las audiencias de arbitraje se llevarán a cabo en el condado (o parroquia) de su dirección de facturación y usted y un representante de CNN deberán asistir en persona. Al concluir el procedimiento de arbitraje, el árbitro emitirá una decisión por escrito razonada que sea suficiente para explicar los hallazgos y conclusiones esenciales en los que se basa el laudo. La decisión del árbitro es vinculante solo entre usted y CNN, y no tendrá ningún efecto preclusivo en otro arbitraje o procedimiento que involucre a una parte diferente. El laudo de un árbitro que se haya cumplido por completo no se presentará en ninguna corte.\n",
            "\n",
            "Al igual que ante una corte, usted y CNN acuerdan que cualquier abogado que represente a una parte en el arbitraje certifique al momento de comenzar y proceder un arbitraje que está cumpliendo con los requisitos de la Norma Federal de Procedimiento Civil 11(b), incluida la certificación de que el reclamo o la reparación que se busca no es frívola ni presentada para un propósito inapropiado. El árbitro está autorizado a imponer cualquier sanción bajo las Reglas NAM, la Regla Federal de Procedimiento Civil 11 o la ley federal o estatal aplicable, contra todas las partes representadas y los abogados correspondientes.\n",
            "\n",
            "Salvo que se disponga expresamente en la Cláusula de Arbitraje, el árbitro puede otorgar cualquier remedio, compensación o resultado que las partes podrían haber recibido en una corte, incluida la compensación por honorarios y costos de abogados, de conformidad con la ley aplicable. A menos que la ley aplicable disponga lo contrario, serán de cargo de las partes los honorarios y costos de sus propios abogados en el arbitraje, a menos que el árbitro dicte sanciones o determine que el fondo de la demanda, la defensa o la reparación solicitada son frívolos o presentados para un propósito inapropiado (medido conforme a los estándares establecidos en la Regla Federal de Procedimiento Civil 11(b)).\n",
            "\n",
            "(4) Tarifas del Arbitraje: El pago de las tarifas del arbitraje (las tarifas impuestas por el administrador del arbitraje, incluyendo las tarifas de presentación, árbitro y audiencia) se regirá por las Reglas NAM aplicables, a menos que usted califique para una exención de las tarifas según la ley aplicable. Si después de agotar cualquier exención de tarifas potencialmente disponible, el árbitro determina que las tarifas de arbitraje serán prohibitivas para usted en comparación con un litigio judicial, pagaremos el monto de sus tarifas de presentación, arbitraje y audiencia en el arbitraje que el árbitro considere necesario para evitar que el arbitraje tenga un costo prohibitivo, independientemente del resultado del arbitraje, a menos que el árbitro determine que su(s) reclamo(s) fue(ron) frívolo(s) o presentado(s) para un propósito inapropiado o presentados de mala fe. Usted y nosotros acordamos que el arbitraje debe ser económicamente eficiente para todas las partes y que cualquiera de las partes puede recurrir a NAM para abordar la reducción o el aplazamiento de las tarifas.\n",
            "\n",
            "(5) Confidencialidad: A solicitud de cualquiera de las partes, el árbitro emitirá una orden exigiendo que la información confidencial de cualquiera de las partes divulgada durante el arbitraje (ya sea en documentos u oralmente) no se use ni divulgue excepto en relación con el arbitraje o con un procedimiento para hacer cumplir el laudo arbitral y que cualquier presentación judicial permitida que contenga información confidencial debe hacerse en sobre sellado en la máxima medida permitida por la ley aplicable.\n",
            "\n",
            "(6) Oferta de Transacción: En cualquier arbitraje entre usted y CNN, la parte demandada puede, pero no está obligada, a hacer una oferta de transacción por escrito en cualquier momento antes de la audiencia probatoria o, si se permite una excepción preliminar, antes de que se acoja la excepción preliminar. El monto o los términos de cualquier oferta de transacción no se pueden divulgar al árbitro hasta después de que el árbitro emita un laudo sobre el reclamo. Si el laudo se emite a favor de la otra parte y es menor que la oferta de transacción de la parte demandada o si el laudo es a favor de la parte demandada, la otra parte debe pagar los costos incurridos por la parte demandada después de que se hizo la oferta, incluidos los honorarios de los abogados. Si alguna ley o jurisprudencia aplicable prohíbe el traslado de los costos incurridos en el arbitraje, entonces la oferta en esta disposición servirá para cesar la acumulación de los costos a los que la parte que presenta la demanda pueda tener derecho por el fundamento de la acción en virtud de la cual está demandando.\n",
            "\n",
            "(7) Requisito de Reparación Individual: el árbitro puede otorgar una reparación declaratoria o cautelar solo a favor de la parte individual que busca la reparación y solo en la medida necesaria para proporcionar la reparación justificada por el reclamo individual de esa parte. EN LA MEDIDA MÁXIMA QUE LO PERMITA LA LEY APLICABLE, USTED Y NOSOTROS ACORDAMOS QUE CADA UNO PUEDE PRESENTAR RECLAMACIONES EN CONTRA DEL OTRO ÚNICAMENTE EN CARACTER INDIVIDUAL, Y NO COMO DEMANDANTE O MIEMBRO DE UNA CLASE EN UN PRETENDIDO PROCEDIMIENTO COLECTIVO, REPRESENTATIVO, O DE PROCURADOR GENERAL PRIVADO. Asimismo, a menos que tanto usted como nosotros acordemos lo contrario, el árbitro no puede consolidar las reclamaciones de más de una persona y no puede presidir ninguna forma de procedimiento representativo, colectivo o de procurador general privado. Si, después del agotamiento de todos los recursos, alguna de estas prohibiciones relativas a medidas cautelares o declaratorias no individualizadas; reclamos colectivos, representativos y de procurador general privado; y consolidación, se resuelve que no es ejecutable con respecto a un reclamo en particular o con respecto a una solicitud de reparación en particular (como una solicitud de medida cautelar solicitada con respecto a un reclamo en particular), entonces las partes acuerdan que tal reclamo o solicitud de reparación será decidido por una corte competente, después de que se hayan arbitrado todas las demás reclamaciones arbitrables y solicitudes de reparación. Usted acepta que cualquier arbitraje entre usted y CNN estará sujeto a esta Sección 12 y no a acuerdo(s) de arbitraje previo(s) que haya tenido con CNN y, sin perjuicio de cualquier disposición en contrario en este Acuerdo, usted acepta que esta Sección 12 modifica cualquier acuerdo de arbitraje previo que tuvo con CNN, incluso con respecto a reclamos que surgieron antes de este o cualquier acuerdo de arbitraje anterior.\n",

            "(8) Exclusión de Cambios Futuros: Sin perjuicio de cualquier disposición en contrario, si CNN realiza algún cambio en el futuro a esta Cláusula de Arbitraje (que no sea un cambio en la Dirección de Notificación), usted puede rechazar dicho cambio enviando un correo electrónico a CNN a notice@wbd.com dentro de los 30 días posteriores a la publicación de la cláusula de arbitraje modificada, que proporcione: (i) su nombre legal completo, (ii) su dirección postal completa, (iii) su número de teléfono, (iv) si corresponde, el nombre de usuario o la dirección de correo electrónico asociados con cualquier potencial cuenta o boletín; y (v) la fecha aproximada de su uso inicial del Sitio relevante. Dicho correo electrónico de exclusión debe ser enviado por usted personalmente, y no por su agente, abogado o cualquier otra persona que pretenda actuar en su nombre. Debe incluir una declaración, firmada personalmente por usted, de que desea rechazar el cambio a la Cláusula de Arbitraje. Esta no es una exclusión del arbitraje en su totalidad.\n",

            "Si, en cualquier momento, 25 o más demandantes (incluido usted) presentan Notificaciones o pretenden presentar solicitudes de arbitraje planteando reclamos similares contra la otra parte o partes relacionadas, por abogado(s) o entidad(es) iguales o coordinadas, de conformidad con la definición y los criterios de Presentaciones Masivas (\"Presentación Masiva\") establecidos en las Reglas y Procedimientos Complementarios de Resolución de Disputas de Presentación Masiva de NAM (\"Reglas de Presentación Masiva de NAM\", disponibles en https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/ (disponible en inglés únicamente)), usted y nosotros acordamos que se aplicarán los procedimientos adicionales establecidos a continuación. Las partes acuerdan que a lo largo de este proceso, sus abogados deberán reunirse y consultarse para discutir modificaciones a estos procedimientos en función de las necesidades particulares de la Presentación Masiva. Las partes reconocen y aceptan que al optar por participar en una Presentación Masiva, la resolución de su disputa podría retrasarse. Cualquier período de prescripción aplicable (incluido la prescripción conforme a la ley) y los plazos de las tarifas de presentación se suspenderán a partir del momento en que se inicie la Notificación Obligatoria Previa al Arbitraje y Procedimientos Informales de Resolución de Disputas, siempre y cuando la Notificación previa al arbitraje cumpla con los requisitos de la Sección 12.2, y hasta que su reclamo sea seleccionado para continuar como parte de un proceso por etapas o se resuelva por acuerdo, se retire, sea resuelto de otro modo o se excluya del arbitraje.\n",
            "\n",
            "Etapa Uno: Los abogados de los demandantes y los abogados de CNN seleccionarán cada uno 25 reclamos por lado (50 reclamos en total) para presentar y proceder en arbitrajes individuales como parte de un proceso por etapas. Cada uno de estos arbitrajes individuales se asignará a un único y diferente árbitro, a menos que las partes acuerden lo contrario por escrito. Los reclamos restantes no se presentarán ni se considerarán presentados a arbitraje, ni se cobrarán las tarifas de arbitraje en relación con esos reclamos, a menos y hasta que sean seleccionados para ser presentados en procedimientos de arbitraje individuales como parte de un proceso por etapas. Después de que se complete este grupo inicial de procedimientos por etapas, las partes participarán prontamente en una sesión de mediación global de todos los reclamos restantes con un juez de una corte federal o estatal retirado y CNN pagará los honorarios del mediador.\n",
            "\n",
            "Etapa Dos: Si los reclamos restantes no se resuelven en este momento, los abogados de los demandantes y los abogados de CNN seleccionarán cada uno 50 reclamos por lado (100 reclamos en total) para presentar y proceder en arbitrajes individuales como parte de un segundo proceso por etapas, sujeto a cualquier cambio procesal que las partes acuerden por escrito. Cada uno de estos arbitrajes individuales se asignará a un único y diferente árbitro, a menos que las partes acuerden lo contrario por escrito. Los reclamos restantes no se presentarán ni se considerarán presentados a arbitraje, ni se cobrarán las tarifas de arbitraje en relación con esos reclamos, a menos y hasta que se seleccionen para ser presentados en procedimientos de arbitraje individuales como parte de un proceso por etapas. Después de que se complete este segundo conjunto de procedimientos por etapas, las partes participarán de inmediato en una sesión de mediación global de todos los reclamos restantes con un juez de una corte federal o estatal retirado y CNN pagará los honorarios del mediador.\n",

            "Etapa Tres: Si los reclamos restantes no se resuelven en este momento, los abogados de los demandantes y los abogados de CNN seleccionarán cada uno 100 reclamos por parte (200 reclamos en total) para presentar y proceder en arbitrajes individuales como parte de un tercer proceso por etapas, sujeto a cualquier cambio procesal que las partes acuerden por escrito. Los reclamos restantes no se presentarán ni se considerarán presentados a arbitraje, ni se cobrarán las tarifas de arbitraje en relación con esos reclamos, a menos y hasta que se seleccionen para ser presentados en procedimientos de arbitraje individuales como parte de un proceso por etapas. Después de este tercer conjunto de procedimientos por etapas, los abogados de los demandantes pueden elegir que las partes participen en una sesión de mediación global de todos los reclamos restantes con un juez de una corte federal o estatal retirado.\n",

            "\n",
            "Opción Uno: Usted y CNN pueden por separado o por acuerdo, optar por la exclusión del arbitraje y elegir que su reclamo se presente en una corte de conformidad con el Acuerdo. Usted puede optar por la exclusión del arbitraje proporcionando una notificación, individual y firmada personalmente por usted, de su intención de optar por la exclusión del arbitraje, enviando un correo electrónico a CNN a notice@wbd.com. Dicho correo electrónico de exclusión debe ser enviado por usted personalmente, y no por su agente, abogado o cualquier otra persona que pretenda actuar en su nombre. Debe incluir una declaración firmada personalmente por usted de que desea optar por la exclusión del arbitraje dentro de los 30 días posteriores a la conclusión de la Etapa 3 o de la mediación electiva asociada con la Etapa 3. CNN puede excluir su reclamo de arbitraje enviando a su abogado una notificación individual, personalmente firmada, de su intención de excluirlo, dentro de los 14 días posteriores a la expiración de su período de 30 días para optar por la exclusión. Los abogados de las partes pueden acordar ajustar estos plazos.\n",

            "\n",
            "Opción Dos: Si ni usted ni CNN eligen que su reclamo se escuche en una corte de acuerdo con la Opción Uno, entonces usted acepta que su reclamo se resolverá como parte de un procedimiento de arbitraje individual continuo y por etapas como se establece a continuación. Suponiendo que el número de reclamaciones restantes supere las 200, se seleccionarán al azar 200 reclamaciones (o se seleccionarán a través de un proceso acordado por los abogados de las partes) para presentarlas y proceder en arbitrajes individuales como parte de un proceso por etapas. Si el número de reclamaciones restantes es inferior a 200, entonces todas esas reclamaciones se presentarán y procederán en arbitrajes individuales. Los reclamos restantes no se presentarán ni se considerarán presentados a arbitraje, ni se cobrarán tarifas de arbitraje en relación con esos reclamos, a menos y hasta que sean seleccionados para ser presentados en procedimientos de arbitraje individuales como parte de un proceso por etapas. Después de que cada conjunto de 200 reclamaciones se resuelva, arribe a un acuerdo, se retire o se resuelva de otra forma, este proceso se repetirá de acuerdo con estos parámetros. Se alienta a los abogados de las partes a que se reúnan y consulten, participen en la mediación y se comprometan entre sí y con NAM (incluso a través de un Árbitro Procesal) para explorar formas de simplificar la resolución de reclamos, aumentar la cantidad de reclamos para proceder en cualquier momento, promover la eficiencia, conservar los recursos y resolver las reclamaciones restantes.\n",

            "Una corte competente tendrá la autoridad para ejecutar estas disposiciones de Presentación Masiva y, si es necesario, prohibir la presentación masiva, continuación o administración de arbitrajes, y la valuación de las tarifas de arbitraje. Si estos procedimientos adicionales aplican a su reclamo, y una corte competente determina que no son exigibles en cuanto a su reclamo, entonces su reclamo procederá en una corte competente de conformidad con este Acuerdo.\n",
            "\n",
            "Usted y CNN acordamos que ambos valoramos la integridad y la eficiencia del arbitraje y deseamos emplear el proceso para la resolución justa de disputas genuinas y sinceras entre nosotros.

Esto significa que usted y CNN no pueden presentar un reclamo en nombre de una clase o grupo y no pueden presentar un reclamo en nombre de ninguna otra persona a menos que lo hagan como padre, tutor o guardián de un menor o en otra capacidad similar por un individuo que de otro modo no puede presentar su propio reclamo individual. Esto también significa que usted y CNN no pueden participar en ningún procedimiento de clase, colectivo, consolidado, de procurador general privado o representativo presentado por un tercero.

The contentious remarks, uttered during a public appearance, ignited anger and prompted calls for a boycott of Patanjali, the FMCG company headquartered in Haridwar and co-founded by Ramdev in 2006. The phrase that he allegedly said referencing the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) stirred controversy, with social media users deeming it offensive to this community.Yoga guru and Patanjali founder Baba Ramdev (PTI photo)NEW DELHI: In an effort to quell the controversy surrounding his recent comments, yoga guru andPatanjali founder Baba Ramdevissued a clarification on Saturday after a video surfaced on social media platform X. Thecontroversial remarks, made during a public appearance, triggered outrage, leading to calls for a boycott against Patanjali, the Haridwar-based FMCG company co-founded by Ramdev in 2006.In the video circulating on X, Baba Ramdev, while engaged in a ritual on stage before a large audience, was heard saying, \"Mera mool gotra hai brahma gotra. Aur main hoon agnihotri. Agnihotri brahmin hoon main. Bole Babaji aap toh OBC ho. OBC wale aisi taisi karaye. Faltu.\" (My primary gotra is brahma gotra. And I am an Agnihotri. I am an Agnihotri Brahmin. They say, 'Babaji, you are an OBC...').The term OBC refers to a collective classification employed by the government of India to identify caste groups that face educational or social disadvantages, encompassing historically marginalized groups beyond those recognized as Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The phrase referencing the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) stirred controversy, with social media users deeming it offensive to this community.The controversy gained momentum on social media, with Hansraj Meena, founder of the socio-cultural group Tribal Army, expressing his displeasure on platform X. Meena said, \"Ramdev, you become a Brahmin. Become a Thakur. Become a tradesman. I do not mind. But how can you show hypocrisy of caste superiority and insult theOBC communityin such a way? Keep in mind, the day the OBC community boycotts Patanjali's goods, this shop will get shut.\" His post included the hashtag #BoycottPatanjali.Responding to the growing backlash,Baba Ramdevaddressed the controversy, saying, \"I said Owaisi and not OBC.\" Ramdev suggested that his comment might have been a reference to Asaduddin Owaisi or his brother Akbaruddin Owaisi, both associated with the All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) party.\"You know Owaisi is not right in his mind, so what's the problem,\" he remarked when questioned about the controversial statement.Ramdev further added, \"Owaisi and his ancestors have always harbored anti-national sentiments. We shouldn't take him seriously.\" Despite reporters emphasizing the term \"OBC,\" Ramdev insisted, \"I have never said anything wrong about OBC [people].\"Explore Your Financial Landscape with Personalized Credit Insights.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.
