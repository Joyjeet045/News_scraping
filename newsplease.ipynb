Scientists are debating when it is ethically acceptable to use an embryo in scientific research. Photo: Shutterstock\\nLoosening the restrictions\\nIn 2021, the US-based International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) became the first scientific body to try and loosen the restriction, with a new guideline suggesting a longer period of embryo culture could be acceptable.\\nAccording to the guideline, a specialised scientific and ethical oversight mechanism should be used to decide whether the extension is required or justified by the research goal “if local norms and regulations allow and there is broad public support”.\\nChina was quick to act on the change. In the same year, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) appointed and funded a handful of scientists to research the issue, according to Tan Tao, one of the participants.\\n“Since 2019, there have been intensifying voices in the academic community talking about whether or not the 14-day rule should be pushed forward,” he said.\\nTan, a professor at the Institute of Primate Translational Medicine at Kunming University of Science and Technology (KUST) in Yunnan province, said the research included several rounds of discussions among the scientific community.\\nIn their findings published in November, the researchers – led by senior zoologist and CAS academician Ji Weizhi, who also works at KUST – suggested policymakers consider a “reasonable” extension of the 14-day rule if cases were “thoroughly justified and evaluated”.\\n03:06 Babies on Mars? Dutch firm conducts space sex research Babies on Mars? Dutch firm conducts space sex research\\nThe paper, which appeared in the Bulletin of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, specifically proposed that research on human embryos could be allowed to continue for 25-28 days.\\nHowever, the Chinese researchers said experimentation must be stopped earlier if the embryos developed a heartbeat or neural tube – considered important biological characteristics that distinguish an embryo from a human being.\\nThe researchers said scientific advances had led to updated knowledge and evidence that may challenge the established rules and ethics.\\nIn the 1980s, for example, it was accepted that the nervous system develops between 17 and 22 days after fertilisation. However, recent findings suggest that functional connections between nerve cells do not form until after day 42, they said.\\n‘Treat human embryos with extreme caution’\\nZhai Xiaomei, executive director of the Centre for Bioethics at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, said the paper’s recommendations “reflect more the attitudes and needs of scientists”.\\n“Evidence of scientific necessity and great medical value must be presented [if scientists propose to exceed the 14-day convention], and we still need to treat human embryos with extreme caution,” she said.\\nZhai, who is also a member of the ISSCR’s ethics committee, said the community should always chew on the question of whether humanity should do whatever it can do.\\nA single cell is removed from a human embryo to be used in generating embryonic stem cells for scientific research. Photo: Advanced Cell Technology/AP\\nSpeaking in her ISSCR role, Zhai said the society’s position was clear – “that an extension should be considered only when necessary and sufficient conditions have been met”.\\nScientists in Britain are also calling for a review of the 14-day rule, with the Babraham Institute’s Peter Rugg-Gunn highlighting the potential health benefits, particularly in cases of recurrent miscarriages, in an interview with The Guardian last month.\\n“We are at the point now where technically these experiments are probably possible,” he said.\\n“There is a very high likelihood that if research could continue, the new knowledge would have benefits to health.”\\nIn the US, the topic has also stirred discussion, with some states considering relaxing the limits, according to Wu Jun, an associate professor at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Centre’s molecular biology department.\\nBut he added that each state, and even individual research institutions, has the discretion to set its own policies, although there would be a consensus at the federal level.\\nThe origin of the embryo debate\\nThe debate originated with the birth of the world’s first “test tube baby” in Britain in 1978, and included the ethics of embryo disposal, as well as the research possibilities that were opening up.\\nThe issue’s complexities mirror the abortion discussion – a crossroads where different cultural, scientific, religious, ethical and other value judgments collide – and this is reflected in the range of policies adopted by different countries.\\n04:38 Protests across US after Supreme Court's decision to overturn abortion rights Protests across US after Supreme Court's decision to overturn abortion rights\\nThe 14-day rule – enacted into law in Britain in 1990 and endorsed by the US National Institutes of Health in 1994, with other countries following – aimed to strike a balance between the potential benefits of research and the special status of the human embryo.\\nChina did not introduce the rule into its regulatory framework until 2003, leading to some international criticism. Also, unlike the US – where some states ban abortions and all embryonic research – China’s women have a universal right to access abortion.\\nWu, who works in Texas where abortions and embryonic research are banned, said one reason that China is at the forefront of the field could be its “relatively lax administrative policies”.\\nA biologist working in embryonic research, who declined to be named because of the issue’s sensitivity, said he did not expect China to be the first country to lift the 14-day restriction.\\n“China may wait until the UK or the US take this step first and then follow up,” he said, adding that the country may be reluctant to appear too radical on the ethical front, especially after He Jiankui’s gene-edited baby scandal of 2018.\\nChina ‘should be cautious’ with law\\nA Chinese academic in the field of scientific ethics, who also asked for anonymity, said China should be cautious about changing its policy on scientific embryo research.\\nIn the race to occupy the high ground in science and technology, Chinese scientists had sometimes given the negative impression that they do not follow the rules and do “whatever they want”, he said.\\nChinese scientist He Jiankui, seen in February 2023, set off an ethical debate five years previously with claims that he had made the world’s first genetically edited babies. Photo: AP\\nThis perception, along with loopholes in ethics regulations, had made China an easy target for “ethical dumping”, the practice by some developed countries of conducting research in Chinese labs that would be unacceptable at home, he added.\\nAn extension of the 14-day rule is not only becoming technologically feasible, scientists argue that it could open the “black box” of human development – the crucial period between two and four weeks about which little is known.\\nScientists who study the earliest stages of life have gained insights from pregnancy scans and materials donated from terminations, but are prevented by the rule from direct observations of embryos in this developmental window.\\nThey argue that an extension could uncover the causes of miscarriages as well as congenital conditions that may have their origin in the complex changes occurring in embryos at the two- to four-week stage.\\n“This is the most important stage in human development,” said Wu, from the University of Texas.\\n“Embryos start organising cells to form organs and many birth defects – such as congenital heart disease – occur, so studying this period can give scientists clues to potential disease causes.”\", 'source_domain': 'www.scmp.com', 'text': None, 'title': 'Chinese scientists join global debate on human embryo research restrictions', 'title_page': None, 'title_rss': None, 'url': 'https://www.scmp.com//news/china/science/article/3248062/chinese-scientists-join-global-debate-human-embryo-research-restrictions?module=top_story&pgtype=homepage'}\n"

Seventy-two hours after she bought her ticket, the airline sent her a text message saying her flight to Hong Kong had been cancelled, just one of many the company axed this week.\\nShe decided to fly with Cathay Pacific Airways , which she used regularly over the past three decades, as the schedule suited her needs and she preferred the extra legroom available in premium economy class.\\nWhen Peggy Li’s uncle died on New Year’s Eve, the Dubai-based hospitality industry worker immediately booked a ticket to fly home to Hong Kong for the funeral.\\nAnother text the next day announced her flight back to Dubai had also been scrapped. After she spent hours on the phone with Cathay in a bid to find an alternative that worked for her, Li gave up, obtained a refund and booked a ticket with Emirates instead.\\n“When everyone thinks of Cathay Pacific, they associate it with Hong Kong and … this ridiculous move has only put themselves into deeper water,” she said. “They have tarnished their reputation, and on top of that, they tarnish Hong Kong as a destination.”\\nCathay has cancelled more than 160 flights since Christmas Eve, most of them during the final week of December and in the first few days of January. Photo: Dickson Lee\\nThe city’s flag carrier was once again thrust into the spotlight this week when it announced it would cut an average of 12 flights a day until the end of February in a bid to avoid cancellations during the Lunar New Year holiday – one of the busiest travel periods of the year in China.\\nThe government, which led a HK$39 billion (US$5 billion) rescue plan to help keep the company afloat in 2020 during the pandemic, expressed its concerns.\\nIn December, Cathay bought back half – HK$9.75 billion – of the HK$19.5 billion preference shares that were issued to the government as part of their recapitalisation financing in 2020.\\nThe rest would be bought back by the end of July this year subject to market conditions and the airline’s business operations at the relevant time.\\nCity leader John Lee Ka-chiu on Tuesday told the airline to overcome its challenges “very quickly and very effectively”.\\n“I want our aviation industry to rebuild its capacity fast and completely so that we will be competitive,” Lee said.\\nBut analysts warned that might not be easy and cautioned that further cancellations could be announced during other peak travel periods as the airline struggled with a severe pilot shortage.\\nThe carriers’ pilot union has laid the blame for the problems squarely at the feet of management. They highlighted lay-offs over the pandemic and called for a change in leadership.\\nThey argued, to be competitive, the remuneration package for pilots must be improved to lure back Hong Kong licensed pilots and stem the flow of resignations.\\nHow did we get here?\\nCathay has cancelled more than 160 flights since Christmas Eve, most of them during the final week of December and in the first few days of January and blamed higher-than-anticipated pilot absences caused by seasonal illness.\\nBut, in a memo sent to staff on December 30 and seen by the Post, the carrier also acknowledged that many pilots had reached or were close to hitting their limit of 900 flying hours during a rolling 12-month period, a cap adopted internationally from China to the European Union, and designed to ensure cockpit crews did not suffer from potentially dangerous fatigue.\\nCathay on Sunday announced it was cutting a dozen flights a day on average until the end of February, although more than 20 were cancelled both that day and the next.\\nIn an apology to customers on Wednesday, chief operations and service delivery officer Alex McGowan admitted the company had “underestimated” the number of reserve pilots needed over the year-end period, which led to several flights being axed.\\nThe cancellations over the first two weeks of January were necessary because the roster for this month had been set in mid-December, and the lack of adequate reserve levels had persisted, he said.\\nMcGowan noted 27 flights were cancelled on January 7 but pledged the number had peaked.\\n“The disruption of this scale is far below the standard our customers have a right to expect, and far below the standard to which we hold ourselves,” he said. “I am leading a task force to ensure we identify and resolve the underlying issues.”\\nThe airline has 2,532 pilots, about 35 per cent fewer than before the pandemic, according to the Hong Kong Aircrew Officers Association. But the number of captains and first officers flying passengers stood at just 52 per cent of 2019’s levels, it said.\\nIn the association’s view, the root of Cathay’s current problems lies in a management decision in October 2020 to cut 5,900 jobs globally, close its regional airline and cut wages of frontline staff.\\nRemaining employees were offered cost-cutting contracts that slashed pilot pay by about 40 per cent, while housing and retirement benefits were also reduced. Hundreds of pilots resigned.\\nThe 900-hour flying cap for pilots is a threshold to prevent fatigue, not a target, one employee says. Photo: May Tse\\nAssociation chairman Paul Weatherilt said pilots continued to quit and training new ones to replenish the ranks would take years. He warned rehiring hundreds of Hong Kong licensed pilots earlier let go would require management to improve its remuneration packages.\\nCathay has repeatedly insisted it has met its rebuilding targets, noting the carrier and its HK Express budget arm were operating 70 per cent of the number of pre-pandemic flights as of the end of last year. The group is also seeking to fully restore passenger capacity by the end of 2024.\\n“We are on track with our comprehensive plan to recruit top talent to support our operations and drive our rebuilding efforts,” a spokesman said earlier.\\nExhausted staff, chaotic rosters\\nMark*, who has flown for Cathay for 15 years, said many of his peers were exhausted by the messy roster arrangements, which often involved last-minute changes.\\nFor instance, he was once told that a short-haul afternoon flight had been cancelled only three hours before take-off and he was asked to handle an overnight one instead.\\n“I woke up at 9am on the assumption that I needed to operate the afternoon flight and had no plans to take any nap in the day,” he said. “How could I have sufficient time to prepare for a midnight flight with such a short notice? Not that I can fall asleep whenever I want to.”\\nNot only did the sudden scheduling changes breed anxiety in employees, but the switches could potentially lead to safety issues due to crew fatigue, he warned.\\nThe 900-hour flying cap was a threshold to prevent fatigue, not a target, and any pilot who exceeded the limit would have to be rostered off for a month, Mark explained.\\nFor pilots on the verge of hitting the cap, Cathay had asked them to fly to short-haul destinations such as Taipei and return as a passenger, a leg of the journey for which they received only a quarter of their normal hourly wage, he said.\\nMark said he was once required to report to Cathay City, the company’s main offices near the airport, just after the period of a minimum 12 hours of rest between flights had expired for a departure scheduled in 10 minutes.\\nBut he added, because of the various procedures for pilots, he could not make take-off on time and the flight was delayed by nearly half an hour.\\nMark said Cathay was right to cancel and merge flights, but he blamed the airline for being too aggressive when planning its services and said it had ultimately jeopardised its reputation.\\nHe warned that flight schedules might continue to change over the next few months as he expected more of his colleagues to quit.\\nMark said Emirates had approached some of Cathay’s pilots through LinkedIn, as the Dubai-based carrier aggressively expanded its fleet.\\n“Local pilots might consider joining the airline, which offers the same pay as Cathay, but also covers education and housing allowances and they do not have to pay tax after moving there,” he said.\\nCathay is on course to post its first annual profit since 2019, with second-half 2023 results expected to surpass the figures for the first six months. Photo: May Tse\\nHe added the only way out of the quagmire was to restore pilots’ previous contracts to keep and attract staff and for Cathay to stick to the roster drafts released to employees.\\nThomas*, who has flown for Cathay for decades, said his work-life balance had been thrown into disarray, with the company giving him only the minimum number of days off each month.\\nHe said employee illness was a concern, but the overriding problem was a shortage of pilots, with the ones on staff being close to or hitting the 900-hour limit, he said.\\nThomas argued that management had gone too far with across-the-board measures to cut costs and then acted too late to address the staffing crisis while at the same time trying to keep coronavirus-era pay packages in place.\\nHe added that airlines such as Emirates, Singapore Airlines and British Airways had restored salaries to at least pre-pandemic levels.\\nMorale would receive a big boost if the company ensured the roster was stable and the days-off request system was more transparent and based on seniority, he said.\\n“Money is important, but lifestyle is more valuable right now,” he said. “The full-on and shambolic roster is causing everyone a lot of stress.”\\n01:55 Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific Airways posts record loss of HK$21.6 billion for 2020 Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific Airways posts record loss of HK$21.6 billion for 2020\\n‘Bumpy road ahead’\\nCathay is on course to post its first annual profit since 2019, with second-half 2023 results expected to surpass the figures for the first six months. It reported a net profit of HK$4.26 billion for the first half of last year.\\nThe airline has also increased pay by between 3 and 8 per cent for cabin crew who fly more and adjusted the pay mechanism for pilots.\\nIt gave staff who had remained through the pandemic a bonus equal to up to six weeks’ salary last September and introduced a profit-sharing scheme for the financial years 2023 to 2025.\\nBut Shukor Yusof, founder of aviation advisory firm Endau Analytics, said the relationship between employees and management was “broken”.\\n“Management has to reimagine the way that Cathay has to go forward in light of what has happened, because it’s going to happen again if they don’t do anything,” he warned. “If they want to compete again to be the best in Asia, like they were before, I think they need to spend more money and more importantly, I think, to engage with the pilots.”\\nHerman Tse, a senior aviation analyst at Ascend by Cirium, said Cathay’s spate of flight cancellations was the first significant disruption to its service and stressed the carrier had gradually been increasing capacity.\\nStaffing limitations had been exposed over the holiday period when it sought to add more flights, and therefore needed more pilots and cabin crew, he added.\\n“From a planning perspective … [they] rely on the crew to do high [numbers of] working hours during the peak season, [and] you hope they will support that … You bear the risk without the spare crew,” he said.\\nCathay would strive to keep its market share and so would seek to meet demand by adding flights, especially during peak seasons, Tse added.\\n“But of course, there’s still a challenge for them. It will still take time,” he said. “I believe it’s a bumpy journey for them.”\\nThe airline plans to employ 4,000 staff from mainland China by the end of 2025, including more than 1,500 cabin crew. It said it also aimed to hire 5,000 people this year, and the group had already hired back 2,000 people.\\nBut Yusof said it would take time to train those from the mainland up to the quality for which Cathay was known, one synonymous with “style and efficiency and class”.\\nLondon-based aviation consultant John Strickland pointed out that Cathay had revamped its operation relatively quickly from “incredible lows” when the airline was operating at just 2 per cent of its pre-pandemic passenger capacity.\\nHe added airlines in Europe had run into similar manpower shortages in the summer of 2022, resulting in significant cancellations and delays, following a faster-than-expected recovery in air travel.\\nA mainland Chinese woman applies to be a cabin crew member during a recruitment drive in Shenzhen last year. The airline plans to employ 4,000 staff from mainland China by the end of 2025. Photo: Dickson Lee\\nBut the global shortage of pilots meant Cathay had to ensure it remained competitive in terms of salaries and contract conditions, he said, noting airlines in the United States had raised pilot salaries substantially.\\nLaw Cheung-kwok, senior adviser for the Aviation Research and Policy Centre at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said if Cathay was unable to supply the necessary number of flights during periods of high demand, such as at Easter, it might have to sell fewer tickets over the next major holiday period to avoid cancellations.\\nBut he stressed the overall number of cancellations remained a small proportion of its total number of flights and the airline was still in a “transition period” as it rebuilt operations after the end of pandemic restrictions.\\n“Hopefully things will become much smoother and go back to more comfortable and satisfactory operation within this year,” Law said.\\n*Names changed at interviewees’ request', 'source_domain': 'www.scmp.com', 'text': None, 'title': 'Too few pilots, chaotic rosters.

One can only speculate on Moon’s reaction to such a dismissive statement.\\nIt is worthwhile to reflect on the historical actions of progressive politicians such as former South Korean president Moon Jae-in. The progressive faction in South Korea, appearing somewhat detached from reality, often seeks to placate North Korea by making concessions. Moon, for instance, went to the extent of signing joint declarations with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un at the expense of national security and eventually strained diplomatic ties with the US.\\nOn January 2, Kim Yo-jong, the vice-director of the central committee of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea, issued a statement titled “New Year Message to the President of the Republic of Korea” in which she scrutinised South Korea’s diplomatic and defence strategies while underscoring the significance of nuclear development in the North.\\nFeel strongly about these letters, or any other aspects of the news?

Unless South Korean progressives compromise national security, akin to the notorious traitor Lee Wan-yong, who signed the 1910 treaty that placed Korea under Japanese rule, the Kim dynasty is unlikely to make the slightest concession to South Korea.\\nHowever, advocates for peace need not succumb to pessimism, as the demise of appeasement can mark the beginning of correct action for a democratic, free Korea. It’s time for South Korean society to help North Koreans – to help fellow Koreans enslaved by a brutal autocracy – just as their ancestors confronted the injustice of Japanese colonial rule in the early 20th century.\\nHenry Wong, Kennedy Town\\nIsrael is another Russia, but with a powerful supporter\\nThe Russo-Ukrainian war is approaching its two-year mark and the Israeli operation in the Gaza Strip is entering its third month. Russia claims that Ukrainian far-right militant groups such as Azov and Right Sector are a threat to its security and part of a Nato plot to destabilise it. Israel, long presented as a democratic Jewish island in a sea of Muslim hostility, calls for the destruction of Hamas.\\nBoth Russia and Israel fight with ferocious brutality. Russia pummels Ukraine with cruise missiles, Geranium drones and 152mm artillery rounds , while Israel drops 2,000-pound bombs and has killed more than a hundred Palestinians per day. Large parts of the Gaza Strip and of the southern and eastern regions of Ukraine have been devastated and left uninhabitable, causing enormous humanitarian suffering.\\nA Russian naval blockade has been imposed on the Black Sea and Sea of Azov and the Ukrainian city of Odessa has been a frequent target of Russian naval missiles. Israel has delayed the delivery of humanitarian supplies by the United Nations and Red Crescent to Gaza after the flare-up of tensions on October 7. Palestinians are also having difficulty accessing electricity and clean drinking water, whereas multiple power stations and grain silos in Ukraine have been destroyed.\\nLast but not least, both Russia and Israel are having trouble achieving their goals. Russia is about to fight for two years a war that was supposed to be a week-long blitz and Israeli officials expect to continue fighting for a year, despite their overwhelming superiority in firepower, technology and wealth. What can I say except Israel is basically a younger, smaller Russia, armed with far better propaganda tools and an omnipotent lobby in Washington.\\nDaniel Cheung, Mid-Levels', 'source_domain': 'www.scmp.com', 'text': None, 'title': 'South China Morning Post', 'title_page': None, 'title_rss': None, 'url': 'https://www.scmp.com//comment/letters/article/3247923/north-koreas-message-should-spark-rethink-souths-peace-strategy?module=opinion&pgtype=homepage'}\n"

More than 8,700 schools enrolled around 10 million students in 2022, according to the Ministry of Education (MOE).\\nBut it still lacks skilled workers after spending the past few decades focusing on the expansion of access to higher education – a system that now produces over 5.5 million graduates a year with academic degrees who struggle to find work during China’s slow economic recovery.\\nAs a result, China is expected to face a shortage of 30 million skilled workers in the manufacturing sector by 2025, according to data from the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security.\\nReforms to vocational education will focus on building a “skill-based society”, especially for strategic emerging industries such as information technology and smart manufacturing, as well as service industries such as elderly care and childcare, according to an action plan issued jointly by eight ministries led by the National Development and Reform Commission in June last year.\\nYin’s school started training nurses specialising in care for the elderly in 2021, an area that is facing an acute shortage of professionals amid the rapidly ageing population\\n“When I worked in the hospital … I always felt there was an urgent need to cultivate talent that better meets the industry’s changing needs,” he said.\\nThe former orthopaedist of traditional Chinese medicine said at the hospital more than 60 per cent of the inpatient services went to treating elderly people, and there was a skill mismatch among new workers.\\nAlthough his current school has a reputation that is “not bad”, which makes it easier to enrol students and hire staff, only about half of the teachers are “dual mentors”, meaning they have both a teacher’s licence and a qualification for the area they teach, as ordered by the government.\\nQuality and expertise aside, there are simply not enough teachers for vocational schools due to their low social status and low pay, said Jiang Xinhua, principal of Guangzhou City Construction College, at a seminar held by the state-run Educator magazine last month.\\n“In fact, the government ordered as early as 2020 that vocational schools should recruit from those who have spent at least three years in a company, but we still are not able to find such talent,” he said.\\nLast year, there were more than 16.7 million students studying at higher vocational schools – those targeting high school graduates – compared with about 19.65 million at institutions for undergraduate courses, according to figures from the MOE.\\nHowever, with just over 610,000 teachers, the higher vocational schools had roughly half the number of educators as the institutions for undergraduate courses.\\nThe amended Vocational Education Law, which took effect from May 2022, has upgraded the status of vocational education, saying it is equally important as general education, and vocational school graduates should therefore enjoy equal education and career opportunities.\\nSome schools have invested big sums to upgrade their facilities amid the push.\\nThe Hangzhou Technician Institute in Zhejiang province spent 15 million yuan (US$2.1 million) buying a retired Airbus A320 jet from a Canadian airline as a teaching aid for its students majoring in aircraft maintenance and aviation services , the Qianjiang Evening News reported last month.\\nYin Jichao is working hard to transform the Xian Health School but still struggles to find properly qualified teachers. Photo: Xian Health School\\nThe move “brings a workshop to the campus”, giving students practical experience, the institute’s party secretary Shao Weijun was quoted as saying.\\nBut to many of those who have entered employment, vocational education will only thrive when graduates are decently paid.\\nHan Qifang, a senior technician with Chenguang Cable, a power cable producer in Zhejiang province, said workers in China were poorly paid compared to other countries.\\n“There is still a considerable gap between the income of Chinese blue-collar workers and those in Germany or Japan,” he said.\\n“Though there have been government efforts to improve our income and political status, they haven’t really changed things for us,” said Han, who is also a deputy to the National People’s Congress , China’s top legislature.\\nAnd while Han is an award-winning and somewhat influential figure, he said rewards and cash incentives from the government still often ended up in the accounts of his employer.\\nThe government has rolled out various projects to encourage businesses to support craftsmanship, he said.\\n“[But employers] tend to think that they have paid the outstanding technicians, even at a higher level than ordinary employees,” he said. “So they’re unlikely to volunteer to share the government funds with the technicians.”\\nIn 2022, the average monthly income of fresh graduates with vocational education degrees in China was 4,595 yuan (US$643), compared with 5,990 yuan for those with bachelor’s degrees, according to a survey by Beijing-based education consulting firm MyCos.\\nHan added that because of the low pay for blue-collar workers, the worst performing students ended up going to vocational schools, leading to a negative social perception of vocational education.\\nUnder the existing education system, all students sit two major exams, known as the zhongkao and gaokao, before being admitted to a traditional secondary school and university respectively. Those whose scores are not high enough either end up in a vocational school or enter the job market, feeding into the negative stereotype.\\nVocational education’s poor reputation has also seen its appeal to students and teachers suffer.\\nThere have been news reports about some vocational schools offering fake majors to attract students who hope to enter new professions. Many companies have been accused of exploiting students by making deals with vocational schools to recruit “interns” and pay them below minimum wage.\\nAs part of the reform to this education segment, authorities have encouraged corporate engagement to improve vocational training and have vowed to build more than 10,000 companies that also function as training centres in partnership with vocational schools.\\n02:39 China’s economy sees a resurgence in the third quarter, beating forecasts China’s economy sees a resurgence in the third quarter, beating forecasts\\nBut most companies have shown little interest due to the high cost of training, according to a human resources manager at an advanced material manufacturer in Dongguan, Guangdong province.\\n“It takes at least half a year to train a beginner from school, while it’s easy to find experienced workers directly in the job market. So small and medium companies won’t be very keen to work with schools,” said the manager, who gave his surname as Liang\\n“It is more of an assignment for industry leaders, which have a heavier burden in fulfilling social responsibility,” Liang said.\\nYe Senlin, who owns a biotechnology company in Zhejiang province, was not enthusiastic about collaborating with vocational schools either, especially during an economic downturn when there are plenty of choices in the labour market.\\n“So many companies have shut down and there are people looking for work everywhere,” he said.\\nChina’s urban unemployment rate hit a peak of 5.6 per cent in February 2023 and stood at 5 per cent as of November, according to the latest data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).\\nBut the jobless rate for the 16-24 age group had climbed to an all-time high of 21.3 per cent in June of last year before the NBS stopped releasing the figures on the grounds that the statistics needed to be “further improved and optimised”.\\nYe also attributed his lack of interest in working with vocational schools to the “inability to endure hardship” of the young generation, who are often doted on by their parents and embrace the culture of “ lying flat ”, which means taking a break from relentless work.\\n“Fresh graduates may be able to take some office work, but not really when it comes to manual labour,” he said. “To be frank, few vocational school graduates live up to our expectations when they’re hired as frontline workers.”', 'source_domain': 'www.scmp.com', 'text': None, 'title': 'Despite China’s push, vocational education is still struggling with a shortage of staff and lack of respect', 'title_page': None, 'title_rss': None, 'url': 'https://www.scmp.com//economy/china-economy/article/3246043/despite-chinas-push-vocational-education-still-struggling-shortage-staff-and-lack-respect?module=spotlight&pgtype=homepage'}\n"
