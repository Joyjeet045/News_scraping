(Image source: Freepik/Representational)', 'In 2006, we published a report describing a cohort of 51 children and young adults with Type 2 Diabetes ‚Äî this was a surprising finding at the time. Little did we know then that a supplement used at six months of age containing added sugar (such as in Cerelac and others produced by Nestle, as detailed in a recent report by the International Baby Food Action Network, IFBAN) could also contribute to obesity and diabetes. Interestingly, prior to the current report, a study conducted in India in 2021 revealed that 28 per cent of baby food products had a ‚Äúhigh sugar profile‚Äù. These revelations are particularly concerning for several reasons.', 'First, considering the heightened propensity of Indians for developing diabetes and its complications, every effort must be made to avoid any potential triggers from an early age. Introducing sugar-containing feeds at the age of six months is highly detrimental to Indian infants who are already fragile. Damage to organ systems at this stage leaves permanent metabolic scars.', 'How does such baby food harm the tender livers and pancreases of infants? Constant exposure to simple sugars places an additional burden on the pancreas to produce insulin (resulting in ‚Äúhyperinsulinemia‚Äù), leading to its exhaustion. This process also induces resistance to the hormone leptin and in the process contributes to obesity. Both pancreatic exhaustion and excess body fat raise blood sugar levels and release harmful substances known as ‚Äúinflammatory cytokines‚Äù, which can damage the kidneys and heart and lead to hypertension.', 'Additionally, formula-fed infants continuously exposed to a predominantly sweet taste are more likely to develop a preference for such flavours later in their lives.', 'This has the potential to foster a dependence on sweet intake, perpetuating early organ damage in adolescence and early adulthood. It would be worthwhile to conduct long-term studies on children who have received such products from an early age to assess their risk of developing diabetes and heart disease.', 'Second, there is a notable discrepancy in the treatment of developing countries regarding the presence of excess added sugar in infant formulas. While formulas without added sugar are available in developed countries, those in developing nations, including India, often contain added sugars. This double standard is unjustified and unethical, particularly because some developing countries do not even list the amount of added sugar on product labels.', 'Third, the promotion of sugar-containing infant formulas in India and other developing countries raises concerns. Cerelac, a popular brand with substantial sales is promoted as ‚Äúsupplementary food for babies from 10 to 12 months‚Äù, despite containing significant amounts of added sugar. The high sugar content is alarming and is unacceptable for anyone, let alone infants.', 'Equally concerning are the other unhealthy practices being pursued by other companies ‚Äî these include influencing doctors, medical societies and media celebrities endorsing unhealthy products and claims that infant formula is healthier than breast milk, etc. There is often also an effort to promote such unhealthy products by engineering expert and celebrity endorsements.', 'The inclusion of added sugars in infant formulas amplifies the threat of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease at an early age for populations, like India‚Äôs, with a known propensity to such diseases. It‚Äôs akin to pouring gasoline on a smouldering flame, intensifying an already critical health concern. Regulation in this matter demands unequivocal stringency.', 'Misra is chairman, Fortis C-DOC Hospital for Diabetes and Allied Sciences and the author of Diabetes with Delight', '20-04-2024 at 07:45 IST', 'Here‚Äôs Your Exclusive Pass To Premium Stories']"

From the Google Search bar on the home screen, button shortcuts to launch Assistant and Circle to Search, Google has always introduced some of the coolest features to its users. However, the recent Circle to Search feature has some accidental triggers, which can be exasperating. Acknowledging this rampant problem, Google said that improvements are in the pipeline, reported Android Police.', 'It took many months for Google to actively develop Circle to Search, and they first introduced this feature alongside the Samsung Galaxy S24 series earlier this year. The new tool‚Äôs functionality is similar to that of Google Lens, but instead of taking a screenshot and using it to query Lens, Circle to Search is easy to use. Simply long-press the gesture bar or home button on your device and encircle the region you wish to search for. Google further informed that the animation that sweeps across the screen is called the ‚Äúshimmer.‚Äù', ""While switching between apps or performing other actions with the navigation bar, it can accidentally trigger the utility. Addressing this issue, the latest Made by Google Podcast episode speaks to the Circle to Search (CtS)'s development team, and the company said it still has work to do in this regard, according to 9to5Google."", 'Google also highlighted that Circle to Search uses Lens components for the majority of the heavy lifting, such as visual search and OCR. Everyone on the team ‚Äúspent a tonne of time thinking about what was the fastest way to access it because we knew that could make or break the product.‚Äù It was crucial to them that you could access it from wherever on the operating system. To activate Circle to Search, they choose to long-press the gesture bar (also referred to as the ‚Äúhome handled‚Äù today) or the home button. The team stated that the ultimate objective is to ensure that the tool only works when you‚Äôre deliberate about it.', 'Circle to Search replaces Assistant activation, requiring users to utilise the app shortcut, power button, or hotword with 3-button navigation. However, users who use the gesture navigation, which has a wide but short touch target, complain about accidentally triggering CtS. Google added, ‚ÄúWe still have further to go, and we‚Äôre working a lot on making sure it‚Äôs triggered when you want, and it‚Äôs not triggered when you don‚Äôt want.‚Äù', 'Meanwhile, Google has a lot more planned for Circle to Search, ‚ÄúWe have lots of ideas about what to do.

He recently visited Nepal to discuss freedom of expression in the digital media. Nepali Times spoke to him about new challenges to free media. Excerpts:', 'Nepali Times: Can you tell us about how the discussions with Nepal‚Äôs lawmakers went?', 'Guilherme Canela: My visit, in partnership with the Inter-Parliamentary Union, was to have an open discussion with them about international standards on freedom of expression. It was very enriching to learn the key concerns of Members of Parliament regarding the current challenges Nepal faces regarding the existing legal framework regulating the media and digital ecosystem, vis a vis the immense changes in this environment related to the technological revolution we all are experiencing, and how these challenges can be addressed in alignment with the International Human Rights Law.', 'There is a fine balance between freedom of expression and that same freedom being used to spread intolerance and hatred. What are the main conclusions of UNESCO‚Äôs own study on the governance of digital platforms?', 'Digital platforms have become a new front in the pursuit of peace. They have had a transformative role in advancing human rights. They have democratised access to knowledge and culture, enabled new voices to be heard, and fostered global connections, but, as you say, at the same time they have become ecosystems of misinformation, disinformation, ideological polarisation, and incitement to violence, discrimination, and hate.', 'Such features have undermined democratic values and threatened human rights across the world. Our job, therefore, is too foster the huge positive side of this equation and to counter the negative externalities it generates.', 'Thus, whereas the digital companies don‚Äôt operate with transparency, accountability and due diligence, many countries have embarked on regulatory processes without keeping a human rights approach as a main principle thereby risking the shrink of the civic space and leading to different kinds of restriction not aligned with International Human Rights Law.', 'UNESCO aims to ensure that everyone‚Äôs freedom of expression, access to information and diverse cultural content are guaranteed, while various stakeholders, including governments, deal with the problems of dis- and misinformation and hate speech online. These problems will be better addressed, in a way that aligns with international human rights law, through implementing the UNESCO Guidelines in a comprehensive and coherent manner. In a nutshell, UNESCO‚Äôs proposal, which was debated worldwide for almost 2 years, and received 10,000 comments coming from actors from 134 countries, suggests a governance system that can improve the processes currently used by the tech companies, aiming to expand freedom of expression, while dealing with the negative externalities.', 'But when can we deem the risks so high that governments can justify restricting freedom of expression through digital platforms under international standards?', 'The rapidly evolving digital era has seen the rise of the imposition of restrictive measures on freedom of expression and the press such as infringement on right to privacy, censorship, and the prevention of general access to the dissemination of information, both online and offline, including internet shutdowns. However, the justification for governments to restrict such freedoms on digital platforms arises when there are identifiable and/or substantial risks to public safety, national security, or individual rights which cannot be sufficiently mitigated through other means.', 'Read also: Nepal should be open for South Asia', 'In order for any restriction to be legitimate it must fulfil the criteria set out in international standards on freedom of expression, such as the Articles 19 (3) and 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or the Three-Part Test, which demands that any interference must be provided for by the law, pursue a legitimate aim, and be necessary and proportional to secure one of those aims.', '(Photo: Sonia Awale)', 'In essence, any statutory restriction to freedom of expression must be subject to oversight and review mechanisms in order to uphold the principle of transparency, accountability and prevent abuse of power.', 'While governments may be justified in restricting freedom of expression on digital platforms under certain circumstances, such restrictions must be carefully circumscribed to protect the fundamental rights of individuals and uphold the principles of democracy, pluralism, and open discourse in the digital age.', 'Is there not a danger, then, that states can justify banning digital platforms using the excuse of maintaining ‚Äúsocial harmony‚Äù?', 'Measures applied by both companies and states should always be proportional to the harm that is intended to prevent. From companies, removal and blocking of content and account suspension should only be used as a last resort in the most serious cases. From the side of governments, banning a digital platform should be proportionate to the level of harm it causes and should be accompanied by transparent processes, due diligence, due process of law and consideration of alternative measures to mitigate risks while preserving the benefits of digital platforms for legitimate users.', 'Additionally, regulatory actions should be based on evidence-based assessments and subject to judicial review to ensure they are fair, just, and consistent with principles of freedom of expression and the rule of law.', 'Banning digital platforms can be considered proportionate in certain circumstances where their activities pose significant harm that outweighs the benefits they provide. Here are two scenarios where banning digital platforms might be considered proportionate. Systemic violation of international human rights standards: If a digital platform systemically violates international human rights standards despite warnings and sanctions. And second, Exploitative Practices: when platforms engage in exploitative practices such as facilitating illegal activities (such as child pornography) or enabling human trafficking.', 'However, it is important to outline that our Guidelines do not call on the government to establish a department or organisation to moderate content. The Guidelines consider that digital platforms should not be held liable when they act in good faith and with due diligence, carry out voluntary investigations, or take other measures aimed at detecting, identifying, and removing or disabling access to content that is prohibited under article 20 of the ICCPR or that has been restricted in terms of article 19(3) of the ICCPR.', 'How can journalists protect their freedoms when democracy itself is threatened?', 'Journalists can protect their freedom by first keeping on doing their job and hold all powers accountable. But they cannot do it alone or in a vacuum, neither should they be left alone to deal with existential safety and viability challenges. As proclaimed by all UNESCO‚Äôs member states, journalism should be valued as a fundamental ‚Äòpublic good‚Äô with citizens putting their trust in it also through teaching and encouraging media and information literacy. It demands the State protect media viability, the rule of law institutions defending media freedom from all attacks, including by elected officials, and for politicians committing to respect the fundamentals of democracy, including the role of the press as a watchdog. There is an urgent need to further demonstrate to our societies the value of journalism (and all fundamental freedoms) not only to guarantee political and civil rights, but to guarantee all other rights. When someone is protesting to have better education or better health, ultimately what they want is to protect the rights of education and a healthy life, but they can‚Äôt do that if they don‚Äôt have freedom of expression in the first place and if watchdogs, like journalists, are being silenced.', 'Your report also cites the critical need for digital platforms to protect electoral integrity. How can this be done?', 'Firstly, in UNESCO Guidelines for the Governance of the Digital Platforms, we highlight the need for Digital platforms to recognise their role in supporting democratic institutions by preserving electoral integrity. Their acceptance of the role is not trivial as it implies an engagement regarding democracies. UNESCO also recommends establishing a comprehensive risk assessment process that focuses on the integrity of the electoral cycle leading up to and during major electoral events. These assessments should be conducted transparently and in consultation with all relevant stakeholders and should include a gender perspective to address the escalating online violence against women in electoral contexts. Proactive measures based on the identified risks are essential to prevent potential threats to the integrity of the electoral process.', ""Read also: Don't act on the act, Editorial"", ""Secondly, UNESCO urges digital platforms to ensure that users have access to a diverse range of information and ideas, in line with international human rights law. Attention should be given to automated tools to prevent any hindrances in accessing election-related content and diverse viewpoints. Additionally, digital platforms should review their products, policies, and practices related to political advertising to avoid arbitrary limitations on candidates' or parties' ability to disseminate their messages during the electoral cycle. The promotion of independent fact-checking, advertisement archives, and public alerts is highlighted as crucial measures to uphold electoral integrity in content dissemination."", 'Finally, transparency is emphasised across various aspects, including the use and impact of automated tools, engagement with stakeholders and governance systems, and the identification of political advertisements. Digital platforms are responsible for disclosing funding details, applying equal content moderation rules, and tracking the monetisation of political posts. The retention of advertisements in a publicly accessible online library, along with information on funding and targeted demographics, contributes to an accountable and transparent digital environment during electoral cycles. If put in place by the platforms, these measures will collectively reinforce the commitment to preserving electoral integrity in the digital age.', 'How can digital platforms be held more responsible when Big Tech is controlled from outside national jurisdictions whereas the impact of their content is domestic?', 'The strategy for the implementation of the UNESCO Guidelines for the Governance of Digital Platforms aims to promote the enabling environment for freedom of expression and information and enhance the responsibility of digital platforms worldwide by Building a Network of Networks by fostering international collaboration and cooperation among regulatory authorities and civil society to develop common standards and regulations for digital platforms. This can help ensure that platforms adhere to responsible practices regardless of their location of ownership and may also reduce lawfare.', 'Then there are Public-Private Partnerships to address regulatory challenges associated with digital platforms. Collaboration between governments, industry stakeholders, and civil society can facilitate the development of effective governance frameworks.', 'Read also: Media m√™l√©e in the age of AI, Kunda Dixit', 'Promoting transparency and accountability of the governance system (independent regulatory authorities) and of the digital platforms policies and practices. Human rights due diligence and content moderation and curation based on international human rights standards must be upheld. The governance system itself must have independent oversight mechanisms to monitor the activities of digital platforms within national jurisdictions.', 'We must also empower users by providing them with tools and resources to understand and manage their online experiences through media and information literacy. This includes features for content control, privacy protection, and mechanisms for reporting harmful content or behaviour.', 'Lastly, there must be ethical guidelines for digital platforms that prioritise transparency, fairness, and respect for human rights. These guidelines can serve as a foundation for responsible platform governance.', '']"

Today, Bhutan uses drones and LiDAR technology.', 'LiDAR, Light Detection and Ranging, employs light energy and lasers to scan and measure a target.', 'Drones offer a more efficient alternative to traditional methods, as they require less time and can effectively survey specific landscapes. However, when it comes to covering larger surface areas during surveys, satellite images become necessary.', 'Now, as a part of the milestone project on the Development of a Digital Topographic Map, satellite image datasets will be officially delivered to the National Land Commission Secretariat (NLCS) by the Government of Japan.', 'Facilitated by the JICA Office in Bhutan, the collaborative effort aims to develop high-precision digital topographic maps covering the north-central interior region and major urban areas of Bhutan.', 'These maps, with scales of 1/25,000 and 1/5,000, will provide essential geospatial information with precise coordinate data, serving as a basis for decision-making across various sectors including agriculture, water resource management, and land management.', 'Director of the Department of Survey and Mapping under NLCS, Samten Dhendup, said that the topographical maps generated from the satellite images have multiple applications.', '‚ÄúWhile planning any developmental activities, like constructing a road, we would not know where to begin making it. But when you have a digital topographic map, we can make a digital terrain model or a 3D image, and we can view the image on any electrical device,‚Äù he said.', 'He added that the road layout could be designed using the 3D image, completing 80 percent of the work with accuracy. ‚ÄúWe can go to the field and survey the remaining 20 percent.‚Äù', 'The topographical map can also give the accurate latitude, longitude, height and a 3D model of the surface, which is vital for planning development activities, Samten Dhendup shared.', 'He said that the objective of the project is to enhance policy-planning and decision-making processes.', '‚ÄúWhen we have a tangible model to view, we can carry out better planning.

He said it was around Nu 50 billion during the time of the previous government and would have gone up by now.', 'Jigme said it is not that all hotels are not paying, as some hotels are paying by making use of the incentive.', 'HRAB may likely ask loan deferment for most given their condition and request incentives like interest reduction for those who want to pay.', 'Jigme said he has been part of the core committees on tourism and various recommendations were made to help hotels and tourism. One was making border towns a SDF free zone as business was going across the border, but he said failing that, the current 24 hours SDF free period could be extended to 48 hours, at least so they can be SDF free while coming and going.', 'He said he is encouraged by\xa0 the doubling of the tourist arrival numbers, as it shows that the recovery of the sector will be much faster than anticipated.', 'On criticism that there are too many hotels and more are being built, Jigme said that it is a personal decision for people to invest their money, and in fact, many of the hotels coming up now had started in the pre-COVID times when things were good.', 'When asked about how hotels in the central and eastern Bhutan can be helped, he said the only way to help these hotels is to increase the duration of the stay, as people have to come back to Paro to fly out. He said there needs to be SDF waiver or discounts for longer stays, and the domestic flights need to be more reliable.', 'Jigme said that an international airport and the whole Gelephu Mindfulness City will also benefit the tourism industry due to the spill over effect.', 'He said the northern east-west highway has improved road connectivity, but there are still some incomplete stretches.', 'Another criticism these days of the hotels is they are selling their rooms very cheap, and are going as low as Nu 1,000 per night for tourists, especially the Indian tourists.', 'It is said this is a strategy being used by tour operators in India to cover the cost of the Nu 1,200 per day SDF,\xa0 by pushing down the room rates in Bhutan.', 'Here, Jigme said that when it comes down to bringing down rates it has been true for most travel agents in Bhutan and outside. He said the hotel room rates are dictated by market forces, and when hotels are empty they rather give the rooms at reduced rates to bring in the guests.', 'He said once there are more tourists then the hotels will not push down the rates, and in fact, rates can go high.', 'He gave the example of the Paro Tsechu, when rooms were not easily available and so rates\xa0 were also good.', 'Jigme said that hotels are benefiting from the liberalized policy after the reforms, as hotels can get tourists directly, but at the same time, they still prefer working with local tour operators, guides and drivers, as they are in one country under the same law.', 'When asked about the duration of the stay, the Etho Metho Tours and Treks CEO, Eutha Karchung, said after the SDF discount the duration is more or less the same as that of 2019.', 'When asked how numbers could be increased further, she said that the airfare could be looked at, as third country tourists have to pay USD 400 even for the Kathmandu-Paro circuit.', 'She said that another factor impacting numbers is that the USD 100 SDF is still USD 35 more than the old SDF, and that is having an impact.', 'She said a third factor is the frequent policy changes in the past, and so many foreign companies stopped promoting Bhutan, as a destination, and she said tours are planned out 6 months to a year in advance, and so currently Bhutan is still suffering from the past policy issues.', 'Eutha said another issue is that it is difficult to find people, as the tourism sector has lost a lot of people, and even the ones they get, do not plan to stay longer than 6 months to a year with them planning to head out.', 'The Association of Bhutanese Tour Operators (ABTO) ED, Sonam Dorji, said that a way to increase numbers is to given the old incentives that was there under the USD 65 SDF regime like duration discounts (50 percent after 9 nights and no SDF after 15 nights), tour leader discounts, etc.', 'The ABTO ED also said that tourism sector is picking up better than expected, and it gives hope to the sector, but there is still a long way to go.', 'Sonam said the tourism sector is hard hit with manpower issues, as many experienced employees have moved to Australia or the Middle East, and as a result there are new and untrained people everywhere. He said this is a huge issue, as the personal touch is lost and tourists will not get the same experience as before, and this needs to be fixed because tourism in Bhutan is impacted by word of mouth.', 'Giving an example, he said at one time Bhutan had around 4,000 guides, but there are now around 1,000 left, and while some keep getting business, others don‚Äôt and they too want to move on.', 'Sonam said there needs to be a coordinated marketing strategy so that everybody in the industry is on the same page and with one target. He said there should be provisions to help people during the off season, and so upskilling them is important.', 'The ED said there should be more tourism products, like river side tours where tourists, especially Indian tourists, can get their feet wet, and so there should be a provision made like that.', 'The ED said the USD 100 SDF has impacted the Asian market, as they are price sensitive and even a USD 35 increase is high for them.
